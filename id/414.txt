[Verse 1]
Beneath the earth, a hidden spring
Where endless streams of mercy sing
A wellspring deep, forever flows
The life that only heaven knows

[Verse 2]
No drought can touch this sacred source
A boundless grace, a steady course
Renewing hearts, restoring peace
A river that will never cease

[Chorus]
Eternal wellspring, pure and bright
A fountain of unending light
Through every age, through every strife
The source of everlasting life

[Verse 3]
In weary souls, the waters rise
A whispered hope that never dies
A sacred flow that heals and mends
The spirit’s strength that never ends

[Chorus]
Eternal wellspring, pure and bright
A fountain of unending light
Through every age, through every strife
The source of everlasting life

[Bridge]
Though shadows fall and storms descend
This wellspring’s grace will never end
A sacred gift from realms above
A boundless sea of endless love

[Final Chorus]
Eternal wellspring, pure and bright
A fountain of unending light
Through every age, through every strife
The source of everlasting life
