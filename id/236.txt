[Verse]
The night is fading, skies ignite,
A golden glow breaks through the fight.
I feel the rush, the endless climb,
This is my moment, this is my time.

[Chorus]
Spread your wings, let the light guide you,
Every step reveals a view so true.
We’re born to fly, we’re made to soar,
Together we’ll unlock every door.

[Verse]
The world is spinning, hearts collide,
A symphony rising like the tide.
No chains can hold us, no fear remains,
We’re chasing freedom through the plains.

[Bridge]
Ohhh… ohhh…
Rising higher with every sound…
Ohhh… ohhh…
Breaking free, no bounds around…

[Outro]
We rise, we shine, we touch the flame,
Forever chasing, breaking the chain.
In every beat, in every song,
We’ll keep on dancing where we belong.
