[Verse 1]
I still see the lines where the wounds used to be,
Ghost of my past staring back at me.
Every crack in the mirror tells a story untold,
Of battles I fought and the heart that grew cold.

[Pre-Chorus]
But time is a healer, though it moves so slow,
The scars may fade, but they’ll always show.
They’re part of me now, like ink on my skin,
A reminder of how far I’ve been.

[Chorus]
Faded scars, they never really leave,
Etched in my soul, but they set me free.
Every mark is a lesson, every tear made me strong,
These faded scars are where I belong.

[Verse 2]
I tried to erase them, but they wouldn’t go,
Like shadows that linger when the lights grow low.
But now I see beauty in the cracks they left behind,
A mosaic of pain turned into strength over time.

[Pre-Chorus]
But time is a healer, though it moves so slow,
The scars may fade, but they’ll always show.
They’re part of me now, like ink on my skin,
A reminder of how far I’ve been.

[Chorus]
Faded scars, they never really leave,
Etched in my soul, but they set me free.
Every mark is a lesson, every tear made me strong,
These faded scars are where I belong.

[Bridge]
Oh, they tried to break me, but I’m still here,
The weight of the world couldn’t drown my career.
These scars are my armor, my shield, my fight,
They remind me I’m alive in the darkest night.

[Final Chorus]
Faded scars, they never really leave,
Etched in my soul, but they set me free.
Every mark is a lesson, every tear made me strong,
These faded scars are where I belong.
