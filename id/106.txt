[Verse 1]
In the silence of the night, I see them glow,
Tiny sparks that guide me where I need to go.
Through the cracks of broken dreams, they softly shine,
Fragments of light in the shadowed confines.

Every tear I’ve cried reflects a piece of gold,
Moments lost now whisper secrets untold.
Though the world may fade and leave me cold,
These fragments warm my heart, they make me whole.

[Chorus]
Fragments of light, scattered through the dark,
They’re the stars that keep me moving, reignite my spark.
Even in the chaos, even in the pain,
I’ll gather every fragment, love will remain.

[Verse 2]
Neon fades, but these lights never dim,
They’re the echoes of a hope buried deep within.
When the road feels heavy and the skies turn gray,
Fragments of light show me where to stay.

Each one a memory, each one a flame,
Proof that every struggle was never in vain.
Through the static noise, they call my name,
Leading me forward, breaking every chain.

[Chorus]
Fragments of light, scattered through the dark,
They’re the stars that keep me moving, reignite my spark.
Even in the chaos, even in the pain,
I’ll gather every fragment, love will remain.

[Bridge]
When the weight of the world feels too much to bear,
Look for the light—it’s always there.
In every moment, in every fight,
You’ll find strength in fragments of light.

[Outro]
Fragments of light, they’ll never fade away,
They’re the pieces of my soul that guide me today.
With every step, I’ll find my way,
Fragments of light lead me to the day.
