[Verse 1]
I see the world through broken eyes,
A fading light beneath the skies.
The colors blur, the air is cold,
The love we had, it’s growing old.
Once we danced in the glow of the stars,
Now I’m left with all these scars.
The night is long, the silence loud,
I search for peace but I’m lost in the crowd.

[Chorus]
Fading light, don’t leave me here,
In the shadows, drowning in fear.
I tried to hold on, I tried to fight,
But you slipped away like fading light.
I reach for you, but you’re out of sight,
And all that’s left is fading light.

[Bridge]
I felt your warmth, but now it’s gone,
I stand alone, the night goes on.
The stars once bright, now distant and far,
I’m searching for you in the dark.

[Verse 2]
I still hear whispers in the wind,
Echoes of love that we couldn’t defend.
The pieces we left are scattered wide,
I thought we’d make it, but we couldn’t collide.
The light we had is dimming fast,
A love that never was meant to last.
I can’t stop this heartache, no matter how hard I try,
I’m chasing the ghost of what we left behind.

[Chorus]
Fading light, don’t leave me here,
In the shadows, drowning in fear.
I tried to hold on, I tried to fight,
But you slipped away like fading light.
I reach for you, but you’re out of sight,
And all that’s left is fading light.

[Outro]
Fading light, fade away,
Leaving me in this endless gray.
I’ll remember you, but I’ll let you go,
As the light fades out and the darkness grows.
