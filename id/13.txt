[Verse]
I move too fast, no time to slow,
Crushing walls as I watch them fold.
Every dream, now in my hands,
I make the rules, I change the plans.

[Verse]
Power surging through my veins,
Every risk just fuels my game.
My empire grows, my reach expands,
I’m taking all, it’s all been planned.

[Pre-Chorus]
Nothing’s ever out of reach,
I bend the world, I pull the strings.
If there’s a price to break the sky,
Then tell me why I shouldn’t try?

[Chorus]
I own the night, I own the day,
No one dares to block my way.
One by one, I climb so high,
Above the law, beyond the sky.

[Verse]
I shake their hands, they smile back,
Empty words, a silent pact.
They need my wealth, I need their might,
Together, we can twist what’s right.

[Verse]
No remorse, no second thoughts,
When you lead, you make the odds.
One more deal, one more name,
The system bows, I run the game.

[Pre-Chorus]
Nothing’s ever out of reach,
I bend the world, I pull the strings.
If there’s a price to break the sky,
Then tell me why I shouldn’t try?

[Chorus]
I own the night, I own the day,
No one dares to block my way.
One by one, I climb so high,
Above the law, beyond the sky.

[Verse]
But what’s the cost of endless speed?
Is there a line I’ll never see?
For now, I push, I take, I claim,
No regrets, I play the game.
