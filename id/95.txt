[Verse 1]
I’ve been haunted by the echoes,
Of footsteps walking out the door.
The silence left behind is heavy,
A weight I can’t ignore.
Promises dissolved like shadows,
Leaving me to face the cold.
But even in this aching void,
A seed of strength begins to grow.

[Pre-Chorus]
It’s hard to trust when you’ve been left behind,
When love walks away and leaves you blind.
But healing starts with every tear that falls,
Each scar becomes a story that enthralls.

[Chorus]
I’ll mend these wounds, though they still ache,
Turn the heartbreak into something great.
Every goodbye carved lessons deep,
Through the pain, I’ll learn to keep.
With time, I’ll rise, I’ll find my way,
Rebuild the light the dark betrayed.
These wounds will heal, they’ll make me whole,
Restore the missing parts of my soul.

[Verse 2]
The nights are long, the days move slow,
Memories linger, refusing to go.
I question why, I question how,
How do you stand when you’re broken now?
Yet somewhere past the stormy skies,
I glimpse a truth that never lies:
That even those who leave us stay,
In shaping who we are today.

[Pre-Chorus]
It’s hard to trust when you’ve been left behind,
When love walks away and leaves you blind.
But healing starts with every tear that falls,
Each scar becomes a story that enthralls.

[Chorus]
I’ll mend these wounds, though they still ache,
Turn the heartbreak into something great.
Every goodbye carved lessons deep,
Through the pain, I’ll learn to keep.
With time, I’ll rise, I’ll find my way,
Rebuild the light the dark betrayed.
These wounds will heal, they’ll make me whole,
Restore the missing parts of my soul.

[Bridge]
Maybe leaving wasn’t meant to break,
But teach me strength no one could take.
The hurt may linger, but it won’t last,
For growth is born from pain’s embrace.
So I’ll gather pieces, stitch them tight,
And let my spirit shine through the night.

[Outro]
Mend the wounds, let them fade away,
Find beauty in the dawn of a new day.
No more holding on to what’s gone,
The future waits; it carries on.
Mend the wounds… and finally see,
The strength that abandonment gave to me.
