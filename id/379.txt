Title: Freedom in Forgiveness

[Verse 1]
I held the pain like sharpened stone
Built walls so high, I stood alone
I thought that keeping score was right
But bitterness stole all my light

[Verse 2]
I fed the fire, I clenched my fists
But peace dissolved in smoke and mist
Until I learned the hardest part—
To open hands and free the heart

[Chorus]
There’s freedom in forgiveness deep
It breaks the chains we swore to keep
Not weakness, no—it’s how we rise
When mercy looks through honest eyes

[Verse 3]
Forgiveness isn’t fair or clean
It leaves a mark, but still redeems
It doesn’t ask for time to bend
It dares to love where justice ends

[Chorus]
There’s freedom in forgiveness deep
It breaks the chains we swore to keep
Not weakness, no—it’s how we rise
When mercy looks through honest eyes

[Bridge]
It’s not forgetting, not pretend
But choosing peace where war won’t end
And when I laid the burden down
I found a crown beneath the ground

[Final Chorus]
There’s freedom in forgiveness deep
It sets the wounded soul to leap
And though it costs what pride defends
It turns our ashes into friends
