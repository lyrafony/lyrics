[Verse 1]
Shadows fall across the land
Cold and silent, no guiding hand
But through the black, a flame will rise
A quiet glow beneath the skies

[Verse 2]
No force can dim this fragile flame
It burns beyond all fear and shame
A beacon when the night is long
A whispered hope, a steadfast song

[Chorus]
Light in the darkness, never gone
The steady pulse that carries on
Through endless night, it breaks the chain
A silent fire that heals the pain

[Verse 3]
Though shadows try to claim the ground
This light remains, itâ€™s always found
Not loud or proud, but deeply sure
A presence pure and ever pure

[Chorus]
Light in the darkness, never gone
The steady pulse that carries on
Through endless night, it breaks the chain
A silent fire that heals the pain

[Bridge]
In deepest dark, when hope feels thin
This light remains beneath the din
A quiet strength that calls us near
The song of love we always hear

[Final Chorus]
Light in the darkness, never gone
The steady pulse that carries on
Through endless night, it breaks the chain
A silent fire that heals the pain
