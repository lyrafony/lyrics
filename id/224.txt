[Verse 1]
The sky is falling, but it’s not rain,
It’s a shower of roses, easing my pain.
Your love surrounds me, soft and true,
Every petal whispers, “I’m here with you.”

[Pre-Chorus]
In your presence, the world transforms,
A garden of colors in every storm.

[Chorus]
Rain of roses, falling on me,
Your love’s a fire, setting me free.
Every drop is a kiss from above,
You’re my heaven, my endless love.
Rain of roses, painting the air,
With you, my darling, life is rare.

[Verse 2]
The night is silent, but I hear your song,
A melody of roses, where we belong.
Your touch ignites me, like flames that rise,
You’re the sun that lights my skies.

[Pre-Chorus]
No storm can break what we’ve begun,
Our hearts are dancing to the rhythm of one.

[Chorus]
Rain of roses, falling on me,
Your love’s a fire, setting me free.
Every drop is a kiss from above,
You’re my heaven, my endless love.
Rain of roses, painting the air,
With you, my darling, life is rare.

[Bridge]
Oh, the world may fade, the seasons may end,
But your love’s a rose that will never bend.
Each petal tells a story untold,
Of a love so pure, more precious than gold.

[Final Chorus]
Rain of roses, falling on me,
Your love’s a fire, setting me free.
Every drop is a kiss from above,
You’re my heaven, my endless love.
Rain of roses, painting the air,
With you, my darling, life is rare.

[Outro]
Rain of roses…
Forever yours, forever ours…
