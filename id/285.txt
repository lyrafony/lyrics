[Intro]
Rising winds
Calling me

[Verse 1]
Shadows fall across the land
But my heart will never bend
Through the fire and through the pain
I will ride the storm again

[Pre-Chorus]
No chains, no fears
The sky is clear
My soul ignites tonight

[Chorus]
Wings of destiny carry me higher
Through endless night through sacred fire
No turning back I′ll chase the light
Wings of destiny take flight tonight

[Verse 2]
Broken dreams lie at my feet
But the flame won′t face defeat
Voices whisper on the breeze
Telling me to still believe

[Pre-Chorus]
No chains, no fears
The sky is clear
My soul ignites tonight

[Chorus]
Wings of destiny carry me higher
Through endless night through sacred fire
No turning back I′ll chase the light
Wings of destiny take flight tonight

[Bridge]
Even if I fall
Even if I break
The stars will guide my soul awake

[Chorus]
Wings of destiny carry me higher
Through endless night through sacred fire
No turning back I′ll chase the light
Wings of destiny take flight tonight

[Outro]
Wings of destiny
Tonight
