[Intro – Spoken]
They broke our bones, they scarred our skin...
But they could never break what′s inside.
Because steel can rust… but will is forever.

[Verse 1]
They put the weight upon my back,
Told me I would always crack.
Built their walls and locked the gates,
Said my fate was set in place.

But I won’t bow, I won’t fade,
Fire inside they can’t erase.
Through the struggle, through the pain,
I rise again, I break the chains.

[Chorus]
Iron will, unbreakable heart,
Through the fire, tear apart.
They can try, they can push,
But I’ll stand, I’ll never hush.

[Verse 2]
Echoes whisper in the dark,
Ghosts of fear that leave their mark.
Every scar, a battle won,
Every fall, I still hold on.

They don’t know what’s in my veins,
Not just blood, but something great.
A force that no one’s ever tamed,
A soul that time cannot erase.

[Chorus]
Iron will, unbreakable heart,
Through the fire, tear apart.
They can try, they can push,
But I’ll stand, I’ll never hush.

[Bridge]
Push me down, I’ll rise higher,
Feed the flames, I’ll burn brighter.
Turn the gears, break the mold,
They can’t break what they don’t hold.

[Chorus]
Iron will, unbreakable heart,
Through the fire, tear apart.
They can try, they can push,
But I’ll stand, I’ll never hush.

[Outro – Spoken]
They thought they could own me.
They thought they could break me.
But iron doesn’t bend… it only sharpens.
