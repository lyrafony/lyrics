[Intro]
Lost in the currents, let it go,
Luminous drift, the lights below.

[Verse 1]
Floating through the shifting waves,
Silver skies and neon graves.
We′re weightless in the electric sea,
Luminous drift, just let it be.

[Pre-Chorus]
Glowing trails where shadows fall,
We drift, we rise, we lose it all.

[Chorus]
Luminous drift, drifting wide,
On the edge, where dreams collide.
Luminous drift, feel the breeze,
Chasing stars across the seas.

[Bridge]
In the current, we can fly,
Underneath the endless sky.
Luminous drift, we′ll never drown,
We are stardust, spinning round.

[Chorus]
Luminous drift, drifting wide,
On the edge, where dreams collide.
Luminous drift, feel the breeze,
Chasing stars across the seas.

[Outro]
Luminous drift...
Never down...
