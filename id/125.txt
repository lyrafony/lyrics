[Verse 1]
I see your face in every dream,
you′re the fire under my skin.
Every word, every touch,
pulls me deeper, drags me in.

[Pre-Chorus]
I can’t fight it, I can’t hide,
you’re the spark, you’re the light.
Every moment, every night,
I’m consumed, I’m set alight!

[Chorus]
I’m burning inside, I can’t escape,
your love’s a flame, I can’t erase!
It’s taking control, it’s out of my hands,
pulling me closer, again and again!

[Verse 2]
Tried to run, tried to forget,
but you’re the rush I can’t resist.
Every breath, every move,
keeps me falling back to you!

[Pre-Chorus]
I can’t fight it, I can’t hide,
you’re the spark, you’re the light.
Every moment, every night,
I’m consumed, I’m set alight!

[Chorus]
I’m burning inside, I can’t escape,
your love’s a flame, I can’t erase!
It’s taking control, it’s out of my hands,
pulling me closer, again and again!

[Bridge]
No way out, no turning back,
I’m addicted, I’m trapped!
You′re the fever in my veins,
and I love the way it flames!

[Final Chorus]
I’m burning inside, I can’t escape,
your love’s a flame, I can’t erase!
It’s taking control, it’s out of my hands,
pulling me closer, again and again!
