[Intro]
Wake up, deep breath, another heavy day,
Tryna find myself in a world that fades away.

[Verse 1]
Walkin’ through the city, hear the echoes in the street,
People sellin’ dreams just to make ends meet.
They tell me, “Play the game, boy, don’t step outta line,”
But I never found my freedom in a dollar sign.

I seen good souls break, try to fit the mold,
Chasin’ after gold, but the touch so cold.
Every move they make just a part of the script,
But I’m breakin’ out, I ain’t built for this.

[Pre-Chorus]
They put chains on my mind, tryna lock me down,
But I see the cracks, I can hear the sound.
Truth in the wind, whisperin’ my name,
I won’t be another player in this crooked game.

[Chorus]
Ohhh, no more chains on me,
Done with the lies, let my soul run free.
Ohhh, took my time to see,
This world ain′t made for the real like me.

[Verse 2]
Tried to fit in, but the fit ain′t right,
Every time I bend, lose a piece of my light.
They told me, “Stay quiet, don’t rock that boat,”
But I’d rather drown than live with no hope.

See, I ain′t tryna flex, ain′t chasin’ the gold,
I just want peace, but the world too cold.
Every smile I see got a price to pay,
But I’m walkin’ my path, no more games to play.

[Pre-Chorus]
They put chains on my mind, tryna lock me down,
But I see the cracks, I can hear the sound.
Truth in the wind, whisperin’ my name,
I won’t be another player in this crooked game.

[Chorus]
Ohhh, no more chains on me,
Done with the lies, let my soul run free.
Ohhh, took my time to see,
This world ain′t made for the real like me.

[Bridge]
I won’t bow, I won’t break,
Rather stand tall than be a fake.

[Verse 3]
Let ‘em talk, let ‘em judge, let ‘em laugh at me,
I ain’t chasin’ validation from a world diseased.
If bein’ real mean I walk alone,
Then I’ll carve my road, I’ll build my throne.

[Outro]
No more chains… no more chains…
Let my soul run free…
