[Verse 1]
The world may change, but not my heart,
From the very start, you’ve been my art.
Your love’s a flame that never dies,
In your arms, I find my paradise.

[Pre-Chorus]
No storm can break what we’ve begun,
Our love’s a journey under the sun.

[Chorus]
Forever yours, no matter the time,
I’ll be by your side, through every line.
Every word I say, every vow I make,
Is written in the stars for us to take.
Forever yours, through endless skies,
My heart belongs where your love lies.

[Verse 2]
The nights may fade, the mornings rise,
But in your eyes, I see forever shine.
Your touch is magic, it heals my soul,
With you, my darling, I’m finally whole.

[Pre-Chorus]
No force on Earth can tear apart,
The bond we share, our beating hearts.

[Chorus]
Forever yours, no matter the time,
I’ll be by your side, through every line.
Every word I say, every vow I make,
Is written in the stars for us to take.
Forever yours, through endless skies,
My heart belongs where your love lies.

[Bridge]
Oh, the years may pass, the seasons turn,
But our love will burn, it will always yearn.
Every moment shared, every tear we cried,
Proves that we’re eternal, side by side.

[Final Chorus]
Forever yours, no matter the time,
I’ll be by your side, through every line.
Every word I say, every vow I make,
Is written in the stars for us to take.
Forever yours, through endless skies,
My heart belongs where your love lies.

[Outro]
Forever yours…
Forever mine…
Together, forever divine…
