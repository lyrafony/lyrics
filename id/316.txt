[Verse 1]
You are the soil beneath my feet,
Where roots grow deep and dreams repeat.
No house of stone, no walls in sight,
Just you and me, and morning light.

[Verse 2]
I wandered far through wind and rain,
But in your arms, I feel no strain.
A garden grows where love is true,
And every petal points to you.

[Chorus]
Home is where you bloom, my dear,
Where skies are soft and always clear.
No map could ever lead me far,
From where you are — that′s where we are.

[Bridge]
Even when the world feels wide,
You’re the spring I hold inside.
Seasons pass, but you remain,
My gentle sun, my sweetest rain.

[Outro]
You are the place I’ve always known —
Where I can bloom, where I’ve grown.
