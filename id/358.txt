[Intro]
Smoke rises from the past I knew,
Ashes falling like morning dew.

[Verse 1]
Footsteps echo down broken streets,
Carrying the weight of my defeats.
Dreams crumbled like paper thrown,
Ashes on the road I walk alone.

[Pre-Chorus]
Every step, a memory burns,
Every breath, a page that turns.
I leave behind what held me tight,
Ashes scattered in the night.

[Chorus]
Ashes on the road, pieces of me,
Dust on the wind, finally free.
No more chains, no more lies,
Only ashes under open skies.

[Verse 2]
Smoke and shadows in my veins,
Still I walk through all the pain.
The world rebuilds beneath my toes,
From shattered dreams to something whole.

[Pre-Chorus]
Every step, a memory burns,
Every breath, a page that turns.
I leave behind what held me tight,
Ashes scattered in the night.

[Chorus]
Ashes on the road, pieces of me,
Dust on the wind, finally free.
No more chains, no more lies,
Only ashes under open skies.

[Bridge]
Fire cleanses all that’s wrong,
From fallen hopes, I grow strong.
Ashes whisper, but I won’t stay,
I′m building something new today.

[Outro]
Ashes on the road, fading slow,
From the ruins, I will grow.
