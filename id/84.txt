[Verse 1]
Beneath the surface, the past still lingers,
soft whispers echo through trembling fingers.
A fleeting scent, a shadowed face,
reminders of a time I can’t replace.

[Pre-Chorus]
They call from depths I’ve tried to hide,
fragments of who I used to be reside.

[Chorus]
Whispers of the forgotten break the air,
pulling me back to moments rare.
Though buried deep, they rise again,
threads of memory woven in pain.

[Verse 2]
The echoes swell in quiet rooms,
dancing softly through fading blooms.
Each fragment speaks of love and loss,
a fragile bridge across the frost.

[Bridge]
What’s left behind shapes what I seek,
the scars I carry, the words I speak.
Though time may blur the lines I knew,
the whispers guide me back to you.

[Final Section]
Whispers of the forgotten break the air,
pulling me back to moments rare.
Though buried deep, they rise again,
threads of memory woven in pain.
