[Intro]
Dark skies, streets don’t sleep…

[Verse 1]
Footsteps echo on the empty lane,
Tires screech, another name in vain.
Broken dreams lie under streetlight beams,
Ain’t no mercy when you caught in between.

[Chorus]
Blood in the rain, washed away,
Names on the wall, but they fade to grey.
No last words, no goodbye,
Just cold steel and a lullaby.

[Verse 2]
Every promise made was a promise broke,
Every lie told left a body soaked.
Taught to move smart, taught to stay low,
But the past runs deep when the scars still show.

[Pre-Chorus]
Shadows whisper, sins won’t drown,
One wrong step, you won’t make it out.

[Chorus]
Blood in the rain, washed away,
Names on the wall, but they fade to grey.
No last words, no goodbye,
Just cold steel and a lullaby.

[Bridge]
Storms keep coming, streets stay cold,
Another lost soul with a story untold.

[Verse 3]
Maybe there’s peace when the rain runs dry,
Maybe there’s hope in a bloodshot sky.
Or maybe this life don’t give no grace,
Just another name time will erase.

[Outro]
Dark skies, streets don’t sleep…
