[Verse 1]
The stars are shining, the night is young,
Feel the rhythm where our hearts have begun.
Take my hand, let’s lose control,
Underneath the sky, we’ll find our soul.

[Pre-Chorus]
Let the music guide us, let the moment stay,
In your arms, I never want to sway away.

[Chorus]
Dance with me tonight, under the starry skies,
Let the rhythm take us, no need for goodbyes.
Every step we take, every move we make,
Turns this night to magic that love will never break.
Dance with me tonight, feel the fire ignite,
In your arms, I’m lost in paradise tonight.

[Verse 2]
The ocean whispers, the moonlight sings,
Your touch ignites me, my heart takes wings.
We’re spinning circles, we’re breaking free,
This dance is ours, just you and me.

[Pre-Chorus]
No words can say what we feel inside,
Our bodies speak, let the night collide.

[Chorus]
Dance with me tonight, under the starry skies,
Let the rhythm take us, no need for goodbyes.
Every step we take, every move we make,
Turns this night to magic that love will never break.
Dance with me tonight, feel the fire ignite,
In your arms, I’m lost in paradise tonight.

[Bridge]
Oh, the world may fade, but this moment stays,
In your eyes, I see forever blaze.
Every turn, every spin, every breath we share,
Proves that love’s a dance we’ll always dare.

[Final Chorus]
Dance with me tonight, under the starry skies,
Let the rhythm take us, no need for goodbyes.
Every step we take, every move we make,
Turns this night to magic that love will never break.
Dance with me tonight, feel the fire ignite,
In your arms, I’m lost in paradise tonight.

[Outro]
Dance with me tonight…
Forever yours, forever mine…
