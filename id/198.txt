[Intro]
The darkness closes in, I feel it near,
The light is fading, consumed by fear.
Once I had hope, once I had dreams,
Now all that remains are shattered schemes.

[Verso 1]
I reached for the stars, but they slipped away,
Left me in the shadows, where I’ll decay.
The light I once had, now burns so dim,
I’m lost in the void, drowning within.

[Pre-Coro]
I tried to fight, I tried to stand tall,
But every step I take, I stumble and fall.
The light is fading, it’s slipping away,
And now I’m left with nothing but dismay.

[Coro]
Fading light, slipping through my hands,
I can’t hold on, can’t make my stand.
Everything I loved is lost in the dark,
And now I’m left with just a broken heart.

[Verso 2]
The dreams I built, now lie in ruins,
I see the end, I see my undoing.
The light that once guided me to the sky,
Is gone, and now I know I’m destined to die.

[Puente]
The darkness consumes, the silence screams,
The fading light is nothing but dreams.
I’ll fade into the night, never to return,
In the shadows, forever to burn.

[Coro]
Fading light, slipping through my hands,
I can’t hold on, can’t make my stand.
Everything I loved is lost in the dark,
And now I’m left with just a broken heart.
