[Intro]
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide…

[Verse 1]
Neon signs flicker on the empty blocks,
Sirens hum like a broken clock.
Shadows stretch where the lost ones roam,
Ain’t no heaven in a place called home.

[Chorus]
Dead end streets, no way out,
Footsteps echo but the hope runs out.
Tires screech, another name erased,
City lights dim but the pain still stays.

[Verse 2]
Pocket full of dreams, but the cost too steep,
Tryna climb up, but the climb too deep.
Wolves in disguise, they don’t fight fair,
Another fake friend, another cold stare.

[Pre-Chorus]
Ain’t no justice, just a game,
Roll the dice, lose your name.

[Chorus]
Dead end streets, no way out,
Footsteps echo but the hope runs out.
Tires screech, another name erased,
City lights dim but the pain still stays.

[Bridge]
Gun smoke lingers, truth runs thin,
Ain’t no saints where the night begins.

[Verse 3]
Taught to survive, never taught to dream,
Built for the war, raised in the scheme.
Maybe I’m cursed, maybe I’m blind,
Maybe I’m just another lost in the grind.

[Outro]
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide…
