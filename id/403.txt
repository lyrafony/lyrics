Title: Threads of Falsehood

--

[Verse 1]
Woven lies in silent thread
Binding words left unsaid
Masks of trust, a fragile weave
Hiding pain no one believes

[Verse 2]
Secrets whispered in the dark
Truth concealed, a poisoned mark
Tangled paths of false design
Leading hearts from the divine

[Chorus]
Threads of falsehood, tightly spun
Shadows hiding from the sun
Broken trust, deceitful ties
Webs that trap and cloud the eyes

[Verse 3]
But light can cut through tangled lies
Reveal the truth beyond disguise
Unravel webs, restore the way
And bring the dawn of honest day

[Chorus]
Threads of falsehood, tightly spun
Shadows hiding from the sun
Broken trust, deceitful ties
Webs that trap and cloud the eyes

[Bridge]
Stand firm in truth, refuse the sway
Break the chains, live in the day
Where honest hearts no longer hide
And love and faith walk side by side

[Final Chorus]
Threads of falsehood, tightly spun
Shadows hiding from the sun
Broken trust, deceitful ties
Webs that trap and cloud the eyes
