[Intro]
Faint whispers call, echoes from the past,
A friendship broken, too shattered to last.
The lies they told, the trust they stole,
Now all that’s left is a heart full of holes.

[Verso 1]
I gave you my loyalty, I gave you my soul,
But you took it all, and left me with no control.
Now the silence speaks louder than your words,
A betrayal so deep, it cuts like shards of glass, unheard.

[Pre-Coro]
I hear the echoes, they haunt my mind,
The ghost of your lies, forever intertwined.
I can’t forget, I can’t forgive,
The damage you caused, how could I live?

[Coro]
Echoes of betrayal, ringing in my head,
You stabbed me in the back, left me for dead.
I’ll never forget, I’ll never let it go,
The echoes of betrayal, forever they’ll show.

[Verso 2]
I tried to move on, tried to forget,
But your lies follow me, they’re my only regret.
I thought you were different, I thought you were true,
But now I see the real you.

[Puente]
The echoes won’t fade, they stay in my veins,
A constant reminder of all my pains.
You’ll never know the hell you put me through,
But I’ll make sure the echoes keep haunting you.

[Coro]
Echoes of betrayal, ringing in my head,
You stabbed me in the back, left me for dead.
I’ll never forget, I’ll never let it go,
The echoes of betrayal, forever they’ll show.
