[Verse 1]
Crackling air, a silver glow,
Glass tempo begins to flow.
Each small beat a crystal ring,
Shattering what silence brings.

[Chorus]
Glass tempo, fragile flight,
Spin me under neon light.
Glass tempo, sharp and clear,
Dance away the fading fear.

[Verse 2]
Mirrored echoes on the ground,
Every step a brittle sound.
Hold the rhythm, tight but free,
Glass tempo surrounding me.

[Chorus]
Glass tempo, fragile flight,
Spin me under neon light.
Glass tempo, sharp and clear,
Dance away the fading fear.

[Bridge]
Tiptoe on the broken stars,
Ride the cracks in speeding cars.
Glass tempo in my chest,
Breaking rules, breaking rest.

[Chorus]
Glass tempo, fragile flight,
Spin me under neon light.
Glass tempo, sharp and clear,
Dance away the fading fear.

[Outro]
Glass tempo...
Shatter slow...
