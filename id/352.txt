[Opening]
Flicker, flash, the colors blend,
Neon hearts that never end.

[Verse 1]
Beneath the streetlights, we unite,
Chasing sparks that light the night.
Electric pulses in the air,
Neon hearts that never scare.

[Pre-Chorus]
Feel the rhythm, feel the beat,
In the shadows, on repeat.

[Chorus]
Neon hearts, beating fast,
Lost in lights that never last.
Neon hearts, feel the glow,
We are fire, burning slow.

[Bridge]
In the haze, we break away,
Neon hearts will never sway.
Dancing in the perfect dark,
Living in a neon spark.

[Chorus]
Neon hearts, beating fast,
Lost in lights that never last.
Neon hearts, feel the glow,
We are fire, burning slow.

[Outro]
Neon hearts...
Never fade...
