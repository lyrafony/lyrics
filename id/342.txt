[Verse 1]
I hear the whispers in the dark,
Echoes of a world that left no mark.
The voices call, but they don’t feel real,
A false reality, I can’t conceal.

[Chorus]
Echoes of a fake reality,
A world that’s built on vanity.
The lies surround, they pull me in,
I fight to breathe, I fight to win.

[Verse 2]
The sky is cracked, the ground is torn,
A place of pain where dreams are born.
The echoes ring, they fill the air,
A life that’s empty, a world unfair.

[Bridge]
The silence speaks, the voices fade,
I’m lost inside a masquerade.
The truth is gone, the lies remain,
I’ll break the chains, I’ll end the pain.

[Chorus]
Echoes of a fake reality,
A world that’s built on vanity.
The lies surround, they pull me in,
I fight to breathe, I fight to win.

[Outro]
I’ll leave behind the fake disguise,
I’ll tear apart the painted lies.
The echoes fade, the truth will rise,
I’ll escape this world, break the ties.
