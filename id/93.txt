[Verse 1]
I built these walls to keep me safe,
To guard my heart from further pain.
But now they echo, cold and gray,
A prison forged by my own shame.
The silence screams, it pulls me down,
A heavy weight I can’t renounce.
Yet somewhere deep, a voice ignites—
It whispers softly: seek the light.

[Pre-Chorus]
It’s hard to open when you’re scared to break,
When every move feels like a mistake.
But love won’t find you if you hide,
You’ve got to let the walls subside.

[Chorus]
I’ll tear these walls down, brick by brick,
Let the light in, no more tricks.
No more running, no more lies,
I’m done with shadows, done with disguise.
Through the cracks, I’ll feel the sun,
This is my moment to become.
I’ll tear these walls down, set myself free,
And find connection, find what could be.

[Verse 2]
I’ve worn this mask for far too long,
Afraid that I’d be lost in the wrong.
But loneliness is its own cage,
A storm that leaves me locked in rage.
Each breath I take feels incomplete,
Until I step where hearts compete.
The risk of pain is worth the gain—
To live a life unstained by chains.

[Pre-Chorus]
It’s hard to open when you’re scared to break,
When every move feels like a mistake.
But love won’t find you if you hide,
You’ve got to let the walls subside.

[Chorus]
I’ll tear these walls down, brick by brick,
Let the light in, no more tricks.
No more running, no more lies,
I’m done with shadows, done with disguise.
Through the cracks, I’ll feel the sun,
This is my moment to become.
I’ll tear these walls down, set myself free,
And find connection, find what could be.

[Bridge]
Maybe vulnerability isn’t weak,
Maybe it’s where the soul speaks.
Behind these walls, I’ve been alone,
But freedom lives when seeds are sown.
So I’ll take the leap, though fear remains,
For love will heal through all the pains.

[Outro]
Tear the walls down, let them fall,
Answer the call, hear the call.
No more hiding, no more fight,
In reaching out, there’s pure delight.
I’ll tear these walls down… and finally see,
A world where I belong, where I’m free.
