[Verse 1]
I’ve worn armor for so long,
A shield to guard against the wrong.
But now it feels like chains that bind,
A heavy weight I’ve left behind.
The fear of falling keeps me small,
Yet walls can’t block the tears that call.
What if breaking is the key,
To finding who I’m meant to be?

[Pre-Chorus]
It’s hard to let the world see through,
To show the cracks where light breaks through.
But strength isn’t hiding all your pain,
It’s letting love in despite the rain.

[Chorus]
I’ll stand exposed, no more disguise,
Let my raw heart open wide.
Vulnerability’s not defeat,
It’s where true courage finds its seat.
Through every crack, the truth will flow,
This fragile state is how we grow.
I’ll embrace the risk, I’ll face the fight,
For growth begins in the darkest night.

[Verse 2]
Each scar tells stories unspoken,
Of battles fought and bridges broken.
I tried to hide what made me weak,
Afraid the cracks would make me bleak.
But beauty lives in imperfection,
In honest cries and deep connection.
So I’ll strip away the mask I wore,
And step into a life much more.

[Pre-Chorus]
It’s hard to let the world see through,
To show the cracks where light breaks through.
But strength isn’t hiding all your pain,
It’s letting love in despite the rain.

[Chorus]
I’ll stand exposed, no more disguises,
Let my raw heart open wide.
Vulnerability’s not defeat,
It’s where true courage finds its seat.
Through every crack, the truth will flow,
This fragile state is how we grow.
I’ll embrace the risk, I’ll face the fight,
For growth begins in the darkest night.

[Bridge]
Maybe softness isn’t weakness,
Maybe tears are seeds that teach us.
To bend without completely breaking,
To trust when everything seems shaking.
So I’ll lean into the ache, the fear,
For vulnerability draws love near.

[Outro]
Embrace the cracks, let them remain,
They’re proof of joy amidst the pain.
No more running, no more disguise,
The strongest hearts are those that cry.
Embrace the cracks… and let me see,
The power in just being me.
