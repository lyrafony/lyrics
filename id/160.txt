[Verse 1]
I walk through these halls,
Where laughter used to fill the air,
Now it’s just the silence calling,
A place that once felt like care.
The pictures on the wall,
Fading slowly in the light,
Memories lost in the corners,
Of a house that feels too quiet tonight.

[Chorus]
Empty rooms, empty hearts,
Where we once were, now we’re apart.
Echoes of you in every space,
I can’t escape your empty face.
The walls are talking, but they don’t know,
How hard it is to let you go.
Empty rooms, all alone,
Trying to heal, but I don’t know.

[Verse 2]
The bed’s still made, your side untouched,
The scent of you is all I’ve got,
Your pillow where your head would rest,
But now it’s just a vacant spot.
I hear the sound of footsteps,
But they’re just ghosts from the past,
Each one that fades makes me wonder,
How long this emptiness will last.

[Chorus]
Empty rooms, empty hearts,
Where we once were, now we’re apart.
Echoes of you in every space,
I can’t escape your empty face.
The walls are talking, but they don’t know,
How hard it is to let you go.
Empty rooms, all alone,
Trying to heal, but I don’t know.

[Bridge]
Maybe time will heal the pain,
Maybe I’ll find peace again.
But for now, I’m stuck in here,
With every memory so near.
And though I try to shut the door,
I still hear you, like before.

[Chorus]
Empty rooms, empty hearts,
Where we once were, now we’re apart.
Echoes of you in every space,
I can’t escape your empty face.
The walls are talking, but they don’t know,
How hard it is to let you go.
Empty rooms, all alone,
Trying to heal, but I don’t know.

[Outro]
Empty rooms, empty dreams,
I’m lost inside this silent scream.
