(Verse 1)
We’ve been through so much, side by side
Laughing, talking, and sometimes we cried
But there’s something more I’ve never said
A feeling growing deep inside my head

(Pre-Chorus)
I never thought that we could be more
But now I’m feeling what I can’t ignore
You’re not just my friend, you’re all I see
What if you feel the same for me?

(Chorus)
More than friends, it’s what we could be
More than laughs, more than you and me
It’s something real, it’s hard to say
But I think I’ve fallen, in every way
More than friends, it’s what we could find
A love so true, a love that’s mine
It’s something new, something I can’t fake
More than friends, a love we’ll make

(Verse 2)
I never wanted to cross that line
But now I wonder if you feel it too, inside
We’ve shared our lives, now we share this dream
Maybe love is closer than it seems

(Pre-Chorus)
I never thought that we could be more
But now I’m feeling what I can’t ignore
You’re not just my friend, you’re all I see
What if you feel the same for me?

(Chorus)
More than friends, it’s what we could be
More than laughs, more than you and me
It’s something real, it’s hard to say
But I think I’ve fallen, in every way
More than friends, it’s what we could find
A love so true, a love that’s mine
It’s something new, something I can’t fake
More than friends, a love we’ll make

(Bridge)
What if we fall, but it feels so right?
A love that starts, in the dead of night
We’ve got the chance, we’ll take it slow
But I’m ready, if you say so

(Chorus - Variation)
More than friends, it’s what we could be
More than laughs, more than you and me
It’s something real, it’s hard to say
But I think I’ve fallen, in every way
More than friends, it’s what we could find
A love so true, a love that’s mine
It’s something new, something I can’t fake
More than friends, a love we’ll make

(Outro)
More than friends, it’s not a dream
What we have is everything we need
More than friends, it’s finally clear
That love was always here
