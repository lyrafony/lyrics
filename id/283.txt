[Verse 1]
We burned so bright, we lit the sky,
Now all that’s left are ashes to cry.
Your touch was fire, your love a storm,
But now I’m lost, forever torn.

[Pre-Chorus]
The embers glow, but they won’t last,
A fleeting warmth from our past.
I reach for you, but you’re long gone,
A shadow fading with the dawn.

[Chorus]
Ashes of us, they fall like rain,
A love once fierce, now filled with pain.
We built it high, we watched it burn,
From the flames, there’s no return.

[Verse 2]
The echoes linger in empty halls,
A ghost of us beneath the walls.
I trace the scars you left behind,
A fragile heart, a fractured mind.

[Pre-Chorus]
The embers glow, but they won’t last,
A fleeting warmth from our past.
I reach for you, but you’re long gone,
A shadow fading with the dawn.

[Chorus]
Ashes of us, they fall like rain,
A love once fierce, now filled with pain.
We built it high, we watched it burn,
From the flames, there’s no return.

[Bridge]
Maybe we were never meant to stay,
Our love a comet, burning away.
But even in the aftermath,
I’ll hold the memory of our path.

[Chorus]
Ashes of us, they fall like rain,
A love once fierce, now filled with pain.
We built it high, we watched it burn,
From the flames, there’s no return.

[Outro]
Ashes of us, they drift away,
A silent end to yesterday.
In the silence, I still feel,
The fire that made love real.
