[Verse 1]
I’ve been walking through the shadows,
Where the silence feels so loud.
Every step is heavy weight now,
But I’m still alive somehow.
The night pulls at my skin,
Whispers try to break me in.
But deep inside, there’s a spark—
A faint glow fighting the dark.

[Pre-Chorus]
It’s hard to see when you’re down on your knees,
When hope feels like it’s slipping away.
But even stars shine through cracks in the seams,
And dawn will come after every gray.

[Chorus]
There’s light in the darkness, though you can’t see,
A fire that burns where the cold used to be.
Even when the world tries to bury your dreams,
Hold on tight, ‘cause the sun always gleams.
Light in the darkness, don’t let go tonight,
You’re stronger than fear, you’ll survive this fight.

[Verse 2]
I remember days of color,
When laughter came so free.
Now the sky seems painted over,
With clouds too thick to breathe.
But I hear a distant call,
Like echoes from the fall.
It tells me I’m not done yet—
My story isn’t written yet.

[Pre-Chorus]
It’s hard to see when you’re down on your knees,
When hope feels like it’s slipping away.
But even stars shine through cracks in the seams,
And dawn will come after every gray.

[Chorus]
There’s light in the darkness, though you can’t see,
A fire that burns where the cold used to be.
Even when the world tries to bury your dreams,
Hold on tight, ‘cause the sun always gleams.
Light in the darkness, don’t let go tonight,
You’re stronger than fear, you’ll survive this fight.

[Bridge]
Maybe pain has shaped my soul,
Made me something more than whole.
Through the storm, I found my way,
Learned to stand again today.
The scars remind me who I am,
A warrior forged by broken plans.

[Outro]
Light in the darkness, hold on tight,
Even when the road feels endless tonight.
Keep believing, keep holding on,
Soon enough, you’ll find your song.
Light in the darkness… shines for you.
