Verse 1
You never called, you never cared,
Always late, always unprepared.
But my dog? He’s by my side,
He loves me more than you ever tried.

Pre-Chorus
He doesn’t lie, he doesn’t cheat,
He greets me happy when I meet.
No games, no fights, just loyalty,
Why can’t you be more like he?

Chorus
My dog’s a better boyfriend,
He’s loyal, he’s true.
He doesn’t ghost or play around,
He’s the perfect one for me.
My dog’s a better boyfriend,
Yeah, he’s got it all.
Sorry, guys, but let’s be real,
My dog’s the pick of them all.

Verse 2
You forgot my name, you missed my calls,
But my dog waits for me through it all.
He brings me shoes, he makes me smile,
Even after a mile-long while.

Pre-Chorus
He doesn’t care about looks or fame,
He loves me just the same.
No ego trips, no second-guessing,
With him, there’s no depressing.

Chorus
My dog’s a better boyfriend,
He’s loyal, he’s true.
He doesn’t ghost or play around,
He’s the perfect one for me.
My dog’s a better boyfriend,
Yeah, he’s got it all.
Sorry, guys, but let’s be real,
My dog’s the pick of them all.

Bridge
Maybe one day you’ll understand,
Why I prefer four legs, not hands.
You had your chance, but you blew it away,
Now my dog’s here to save the day.

Final Chorus (Outro)
My dog’s a better boyfriend,
He’s loyal, he’s true.
He doesn’t ghost or play around,
He’s the perfect one for me.
My dog’s a better boyfriend,
Yeah, he’s got it all.
Sorry, guys, but let’s be real,
My dog’s the pick of them all.

Pick of them all… yeah, my dog’s the best.
