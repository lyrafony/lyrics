[Verse 1]
I’ve been knocked down more times than I can count,
Each blow a reminder of life’s uphill mount.
The winds howl fierce, they try to break,
But somewhere deep, my strength awakes.
Bruised and battered, yet still I rise,
A flicker of fire in tired eyes.
Though the road is steep and the nights are long,
The spirit endures where it belongs.

[Pre-Chorus]
It’s hard to stand when the storm won’t cease,
When every step feels like a feat.
But resilience lives in the will to fight,
In finding light within the night.

[Chorus]
I’ll rise again, no matter the fall,
Through every wound, through it all.
The human spirit was made to soar,
To bend and break, then rise once more.
With every scar, I grow stronger still,
A testament to an unyielding will.
This is my power, my sacred flame,
Resilience whispers my true name.

[Verse 2]
The weight of the world has pressed on my chest,
Testing limits, pushing me past my best.
Yet even in chaos, there’s a quiet grace,
A strength that builds in the hardest place.
Every challenge shapes my spine,
Teaching me lessons time can’t unwind.
The cracks don’t weaken; they let in the light,
Guiding me forward through endless night.

[Bridge]
Maybe breaking isn’t the end of the road,
But a chance to carry a lighter load.
The trials we face shape who we become,
And resilience proves we’re never undone.
So I’ll face the storm, embrace the strain,
For every struggle births new gain.

[Outro]
Rise again, let the echoes guide,
Through pain and loss, you’ll find your stride.
No more doubting, no more despair,
Your spirit is limitless, beyond compare.
Rise again… and let me see,
The boundless strength inside of me.
