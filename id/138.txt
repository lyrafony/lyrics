[Intro]
The beat rises… can you feel it in your chest?
This is where the journey begins…

[Verse 1]
I’ve been climbing, chasing dreams that never sleep
Every step I take feels like a mountain steep
But I hear the rhythm, it’s calling my name
Pushing me forward, igniting the flame

Your energy fuels me, your vibe sets me free
Together we’re breaking what used to bind me
The night is electric, the stars align
We’re reaching for heights we thought were confined

[Pre-Chorus]
Step by step, we’re leaving the ground
The music lifts us, no chains to hold us down
No fear, no limits, just the sky above
Baby, this is our time to rise and love

[Chorus]
Higher ground, we’re taking the flight
No looking back, we’re chasing the light
Feel the rush, let it guide you through
Together we’ll conquer, me and you
Higher ground, we’re breaking the mold
The future’s ours, it’s ours to hold
Feel the fire, let it burn so bright
Baby, we’re destined for higher ground tonight

[Verse 2]
The bassline pounds, it’s steady and strong
Every heartbeat echoes where we belong
No boundaries here, just pure desire
We’re setting the world and our souls on fire

The past is fading, it’s out of sight
Tonight we’re shining, brighter than light
This moment’s eternal, no end in view
With every step, I’m ascending with you

[Pre-Chorus]
Step by step, we’re leaving the ground
The music lifts us, no chains to hold us down
No fear, no limits, just the sky above
Baby, this is our time to rise and love

[Chorus]
Higher ground, we’re taking the flight
No looking back, we’re chasing the light
Feel the rush, let it guide you through
Together we’ll conquer, me and you
Higher ground, we’re breaking the mold
The future’s ours, it’s ours to hold
Feel the fire, let it burn so bright
Baby, we’re destined for higher ground tonight

[Bridge]
Ooooh…
Feel the energy surge, it’s pulling us high
No gravity here, we’re touching the sky
The night is endless, no end in sight
Together we’ll reach for higher heights

[Final Chorus]
Higher ground, we’re taking the flight
No looking back, we’re chasing the light
Feel the rush, let it guide you through
Together we’ll conquer, me and you
Higher ground, we’re breaking the mold
The future’s ours, it’s ours to hold
Feel the fire, let it burn so bright
Baby, we’re destined for higher ground tonight
