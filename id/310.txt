Title: River of You

[Verse 1]
The river flows with quiet grace,
Tracing lines on nature’s face.
Just like your love that moves through me,
Carving paths I cannot see.

[Verse 2]
Through rocks and time, it finds its way,
No need to rush, no need to stay.
A gentle force both wild and true,
Forever like the river of you.

[Chorus]
In every current, every tide,
Your love’s the stream I hold inside.
Flowing free, both deep and wide,
A river that will never hide.

[Bridge]
When storms arise and skies turn gray,
The river keeps its course, its way.
Strong and soft, it carries through,
Always finding me, finding you.

[Outro]
The river flows, so do we two,
Forever bound — the river of you.
