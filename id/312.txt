[Verse 1]
Stone beneath my steady feet,
Grounded firm, the heart’s heartbeat.
Clouds above that softly glide,
Whispers where the dreams reside.

[Verse 2]
You are both the rock and breeze,
The steady calm and gentle ease.
In every step, in every sigh,
A dance between the earth and sky.

[Chorus]
Stone and cloud, we move as one,
Solid earth and setting sun.
Hold me close, then let me go,
Together still, in ebb and flow.

[Bridge]
When storms come rolling in the night,
Your presence is my guiding light.
Strong and soft, forever bound,
In you, my peace is always found.

[Outro]
Stone and cloud, beneath the blue,
A love that’s ancient, fresh, and true.
