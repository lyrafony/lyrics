[Verse]
I’m staring at the screen, lost in time,
A world so broken, it’s all a crime.
If I could press the button, make it right,
I’d reset the world, start a new fight.

[Chorus]
If I had the power, I’d press restart,
Erase the chaos, heal my heart.
A new beginning, a brand new start,
I’d press the reset button, tear it apart.

[Verse]
The system crashes, the world goes dark,
But in the silence, I’ll make my mark.
I’ll take the pieces, I’ll build them anew,
A broken past, but a future in view.

[Chorus]
If I had the power, I’d press restart,
Erase the chaos, heal my heart.
A new beginning, a brand new start,
I’d press the reset button, tear it apart.

[Bridge]
I see the cracks, I feel the burn,
The world’s a mess, but I’ll return.
The button’s there, it’s all in my hands,
To rewrite the future, to make new plans.

[Chorus]
If I had the power, I’d press restart,
Erase the chaos, heal my heart.
A new beginning, a brand new start,
I’d press the reset button, tear it apart.

[Outro]
One press, and the world would change,
I’d reset it all, and rearrange.
