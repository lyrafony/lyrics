[Verse 1]
I’ll march with no shoes on the broken glass ground,
No banners or weapons, just truth unprofound.
They built their high towers, but I’ll tear them apart,
With nothing but courage and a barefoot heart.

[Pre-Chorus]
They say I’m too small to start a rebellion,
But freedom begins in the quiet decision.
No chains can hold me, no walls can confine,
This revolution’s alive in my mind.

[Chorus]
It’s a barefoot revolution, no map, no guide,
Just the fire in my soul and the earth on my side.
Every step I take breaks the lies they create,
This is my uprising; it’s never too late.

[Verse 2]
The dirt on my skin tells the stories I’ve fought,
The battles I’ve won without being caught.
Their rules are just shadows; I’ll walk through the haze,
With nothing to lose and a world to remake.

[Pre-Chorus]
They say I’m too small to start a rebellion,
But freedom begins in the quiet decision.
No chains can hold me, no walls can confine,
This revolution’s alive in my mind.

[Chorus]
It’s a barefoot revolution, no map, no guide,
Just the fire in my soul and the earth on my side.
Every step I take breaks the lies they create,
This is my uprising; it’s never too late.

[Bridge]
Oh, they tried to silence the sound of my feet,
But I’ll run through the storm till I’m finally free.
This revolution isn’t loud; it’s a spark,
A whisper of change that will light up the dark.

[Final Section]
Barefoot revolution, it starts from within,
Breaking the cages, letting the light in.
No shoes, no fear, just the strength to begin,
This is my fight, and I’m winning it.
