[Intro - Spoken]
In a world where everything’s painted bright,
Where the lights never fade,
I wonder… are we really living,
Or just existing in a dream?

[Verse 1]
Neon lights are burning fast,
Chasing shadows from the past.
In this city, we’ll never sleep,
Drowning secrets we can’t keep.

Electric hearts in an electric night,
We’re just searching for the light.
No one cares, no one believes,
In this world, we wear our sleeves.

[Chorus]
Neon dreams, shining bright,
In the darkness, we take flight.
Through the haze, we’ll make our way,
In these neon dreams, we’ll stay.

[Verse 2]
Hiding faces, wearing masks,
Pretending life is all we ask.
Chasing moments, we can’t hold,
Living stories, never told.

Through the glass, we’ll break the wall,
In the glow, we stand tall.
Fading echoes from a time we knew,
In the neon, we’re born anew.

[Chorus]
Neon dreams, shining bright,
In the darkness, we take flight.
Through the haze, we’ll make our way,
In these neon dreams, we’ll stay.

[Bridge]
Fading, fading, can we breathe?
In the glow, what do we believe?
Will we ever escape the night?
Or are we trapped in this neon light?

[Chorus]
Neon dreams, shining bright,
In the darkness, we take flight.
Through the haze, we’ll make our way,
In these neon dreams, we’ll stay.

[Outro - Spoken]
Maybe one day, the lights will dim,
And we’ll finally wake up from this dream.
But for now…
We chase these neon dreams…
Forever.
