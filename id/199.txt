[Intro]
I’ve walked through fire, I’ve walked through hell,
But now it’s time to break the spell.
No more lies, no more deceit,
I’ll tear it all down, and I’ll defeat.

[Verso 1]
You built your walls to keep me confined,
But now I see the truth you’ve tried to hide.
Your false promises, your empty lies,
I’m done with you, I’ll sever all ties.

[Puente]
Enough is enough, it’s time to break free,
No more chains, no more holding me.
The path is clear, no looking back,
I’m burning it all, I’m on the attack.

[Coro]
Burn the bridge, let it all go up in flames,
I’ll never turn back, nothing stays the same.
Cut the ties, let the wounds bleed raw,
I’m leaving you behind, settling the score.

[Verso 2]
You thought you could control, keep me down,
But now I rise, I’ll take back the crown.
Your lies don’t bind me, your hate can’t win,
This is the end, and I’m burning within.

[Puente]
I’ll watch it burn, I’ll watch it fall,
No more holding me, no more at all.
The ashes will remain, but I’ll be free,
Burn the bridge, and finally be me.

[Coro]
Burn the bridge, let it all go up in flames,
I’ll never turn back, nothing stays the same.
Cut the ties, let the wounds bleed raw,
I’m leaving you behind, settling the score.
