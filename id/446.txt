[Verse 1]
I’ve worn my shame like second skin
A list of wrongs I carry in
I’ve heard the lies that echo loud
“You’ll never stand, you’re not allowed”

[Verse 2]
I failed the test, I broke the vow
I see my flaws, I feel them now
I’d quit, if not for something near
That silences the voice of fear

[Chorus]
I was never enough, not clean, not right
Still I walked through the thick of night
With nothing to offer, nothing to show
Still I was moved where I needed to go
No gold in my hands, no pride in my talk
Never enough, still I walked

[Verse 3]
I thought of stopping every day
A life like mine should drift away
But steps kept forming at my feet
As if the ground refused defeat

[Chorus]
I was never enough, not clean, not right
Still I walked through the thick of night
With nothing to offer, nothing to show
Still I was moved where I needed to go
No gold in my hands, no pride in my talk
Never enough, still I walked

[Bridge]
I don’t know why the way stayed clear
Why mercy found me here
But every mile I thought was lost
Was paved by hands I never saw

[Final Chorus]
I was never enough, but I was still led
By quiet grace, not words I said
And though I stumble, I’m not erased
I’m held together by unseen grace
Not worthy, not brave, not strong from the start
But still I walked—with a borrowed heart
