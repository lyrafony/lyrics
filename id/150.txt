[Intro]
Cold hands, colder hearts…

[Verse 1]
Lost in a city where the sun don’t rise,
Trust runs thin when the love’s all lies.
Eyes like daggers, cuts run deep,
Everybody’s loyal ‘til the wolves don’t eat.

[Chorus]
Cold hands, touch the steel,
Ain’t no love when the pain feels real.
No regrets, no second chance,
Every man’s fate in the devil’s hands.

[Verse 2]
Stories written in the cracks of the block,
Souls get sold when the price don’t drop.
Prayers get lost in the wind at night,
Ain’t no saviors when the dark takes flight.

[Pre-Chorus]
Shadows whisper, guns don’t lie,
One wrong step and you outta time.

[Chorus]
Cold hands, touch the steel,
Ain’t no love when the pain feels real.
No regrets, no second chance,
Every man’s fate in the devil’s hands.

[Bridge]
No peace, no rest,
Just another name laid to rest.

[Verse 3]
Maybe I was built for the coldest nights,
Maybe I was made just to stand and fight.
Or maybe this war don’t ever end,
Just a cycle that starts again.

[Outro]
Cold hands, colder hearts…
