[Verse 1]
Late at night, under neon skies,
we′re running fast, with fire in our eyes.
Every heartbeat echoes your name,
we′re chasing dreams, never feeling the same.

[Pre-Chorus]
No more doubts, no turning back,
side by side, we’re on this track.
Through the dark, through the rain,
we’ll find the light again.

[Chorus]
Chasing the stars, flying so high,
you and me, we touch the sky.
No more fears, no goodbyes,
we burn forever, you and I.

[Verse 2]
City lights fade behind our trail,
no regrets, no chance to fail.
Hand in hand, we own the night,
fueled by love, burning bright.

[Pre-Chorus]
No more doubts, no turning back,
side by side, we’re on this track.
Through the dark, through the rain,
we’ll find the light again.

[Chorus]
Chasing the stars, flying so high,
you and me, we touch the sky.
No more fears, no goodbyes,
we burn forever, you and I.

[Bridge]
Even if we fall, even if we break,
we will rise, we won’t hesitate.
Every scar, every fight,
makes us shine even more bright.

[Final Chorus]
Chasing the stars, flying so high,
you and me, we touch the sky.
No more fears, no goodbyes,
we burn forever, you and I.
