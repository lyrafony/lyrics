[Verse]
I walk these streets with a silent mind,
No weight to carry, no chains to bind.
I see the sorrow, but I feel no pain,
Their fate’s been written, it won’t ever change.

[Verse]
They beg for mercy, curse the sky,
Dream of power with vengeful eyes.
But if they rise, they’ll play the same,
Trade their shackles, build new chains.

[Pre-Chorus]
History repeats, it always will,
The hands that suffer, learn to kill.

[Chorus]
No faith in their pain, no sorrow to claim,
They’d rise in power and play the same game.
I stand aside, won’t march their war,
The wheel keeps turning like before.

[Verse]
They call for justice, scream for change,
Yet their hearts are full of rage.
Given power, they’d rule with fists,
New kings born from old abyss.

[Verse]
Pero no me uniré, no tomaré partido,
no tengo sed de poder, no necesito alzarme.
Que luchen, que caigan,
después de todo, la historia se repite.

[Pre-Chorus]
History repeats, it always will,
The hands that suffer, learn to kill.

[Chorus]
No faith in their pain, no sorrow to claim,
They’d rise in power and play the same game.
I stand aside, won’t march their war,
The wheel keeps turning like before.

[Verse]
I’ll fade away with quiet breath,
No fear of life, no fear of death.
Just drifting through this endless tide,
With nothing left, yet nothing to hide.
