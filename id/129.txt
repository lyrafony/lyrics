[Intro]
Ohhh… feel it…
Let’s go… tonight’s the night…

[Verse 1]
I saw you dancing in the moonlight glow
Your body moving, I had to let you know
You got that fire, got me hypnotized
Every step you take, I’m locked in your eyes

Tonight we’re breaking all the rules, yeah
No stress, just me and you here
The vibe is perfect, let’s make it last
We’ll live this moment, forget the past

[Pre-Chorus]
It’s getting hot, can’t you feel the flame?
We’re burning up, playing our game
No turning back, let’s keep it tight
Baby, we own this night

[Chorus]
Feel the night, let it take control
Move your body, let your heart unfold
We’re unstoppable, we’re made of fire
Feel the night, take us higher, higher, higher

[Verse 2]
The bass is pumping, it’s taking over
We’re lost in rhythm, like nothing else matters
Your touch ignites me, I’m losing control
This love’s electric, it’s taking its toll

Let’s dance until the morning light
No limits, baby, we’re outta sight
The world can wait, we’re living for now
Together we shine, take a bow

[Pre-Chorus]
It’s getting hot, can’t you feel the flame?
We’re burning up, playing our game
No turning back, let’s keep it tight
Baby, we own this night

[Chorus]
Feel the night, let it take control
Move your body, let your heart unfold
We’re unstoppable, we’re made of fire
Feel the night, take us higher, higher, higher

[Bridge]
Ooooh…
Let the rhythm guide you, don’t think twice
We’re flying high, it feels so nice
The night is ours, no end in sight
Just hold me close, feel the night

[Final Chorus]
Feel the night, let it take control
Move your body, let your heart unfold
We’re unstoppable, we’re made of fire
Feel the night, take us higher, higher, higher

[Outro]
Feel the night…
Higher, higher…
Ohhh…
