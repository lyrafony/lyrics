[Verse 1]
The seasons shift, the winds will turn,
Nothing stays the way it was.
I’ve held on tight, but still I learn,
Even roots can leave the moss.
The clock keeps ticking through the nights,
Each moment slips, out of sight.
But maybe letting go is how
We find what matters here and now.

[Pre-Chorus]
It’s hard to watch the tides roll in,
To see the old fade out again.
But every end is a brand-new start,
A chance to mend a broken heart.

[Chorus]
Change is coming, whether I’m ready or not,
It carves the path that shapes my plot.
Every goodbye makes room for hello,
Every low sets the stage for growth.
So I’ll embrace the shifting skies,
Let the storm teach me how to rise.
Change is life—it’s where we grow,
Through every high and every low.

[Verse 2]
I used to dread the shifting sands,
Afraid of losing all I knew.
But now I see with clearer hands,
The world renews itself anew.
What once was firm may fade away,
Yet beauty blooms in disarray.
And though it hurts to say goodbye,
New worlds are born when others die.

[Pre-Chorus]
It’s hard to watch the tides roll in,
To see the old fade out again.
But every end is a brand-new start,
A chance to mend a broken heart.

[Chorus]
Change is coming, whether I’m ready or not,
It carves the path that shapes my plot.
Every goodbye makes room for hello,
Every low sets the stage for growth.
So I’ll embrace the shifting skies,
Let the storm teach me how to rise.
Change is life—it’s where we grow,
Through every high and every low.

[Bridge]
Maybe loss isn’t something to fear,
Maybe change brings what we hold dear.
The cracks let light into our soul,
They make us whole, they make us whole.
So I’ll stand tall as the winds collide,
For in the chaos, I’ll find my stride.

[Outro]
Change is constant, like waves that crash,
Taking pieces but never the ash.
I’ll ride the tide, let it guide my way,
Through every dawn and every gray.
Change is life—it’s where we grow,
Through every high and every low.
