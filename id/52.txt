Verse 1
You lied, you cheated, you played me for a fool,
But I’m not mad—I’m letting karma be the rule.
I don’t need revenge, I don’t need a fight,
I’ll just sit back and watch you get what’s right.

Pre-Chorus
Karma’s a mirror, it always reflects,
Every bad move, every disrespect.
So I’ll sip my coffee, I’ll take my time,
And let the universe handle your crime.

Chorus
Karma’s got my back, it’s all I need,
It’s sweet justice served at lightning speed.
I don’t have to chase, I don’t have to shout,
The universe knows what you’re all about.
Karma’s got my back, it’s on its way,
You’ll feel the burn of your own betray.
I’m not worried, I’m not stressed,
Karma always handles the rest.

Verse 2
You thought you’d win, you thought you’d thrive,
But now you’re drowning—can’t survive.
I saw the cracks, I saw the fall,
Karma’s knocking at your door—that’s all.

Pre-Chorus
I don’t need tears, I don’t need pain,
I’ve moved on—you’ll feel the chain.
What goes around comes back around,
Your bad choices are where you’re bound.

Chorus
Karma’s got my back, it’s all I need,
It’s sweet justice served at lightning speed.
I don’t have to chase, I don’t have to shout,
The universe knows what you’re all about.
Karma’s got my back, it’s on its way,
You’ll feel the burn of your own betray.
I’m not worried, I’m not stressed,
Karma always handles the rest.
