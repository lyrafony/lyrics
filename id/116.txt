[Intro]
We’ve been burned, but we’re still standing tall
Through the flames, we’ll never let it fall

[Verse 1]
The heat was rising, smoke filled the air
But we held on tight, showing we care
Every scar we wear tells our story of fight
Together we faced the darkest night

[Pre-Chorus]
When the world tried to tear us apart
We found strength in the rhythm of our hearts
No fire could break what we built so strong

[Chorus]
We made it through the fire, hand in hand
Proving that true love can withstand
Every test, every storm, every burning desire
We walked through the ashes, rose from the mire
We made it through the fire, you and I
And nothing in this world can make us say goodbye

[Verse 2]
The road was rough, but we paved our way
Turning pain into power every single day
Even when the sparks threatened to ignite
We stood firm under the fading light

[Pre-Chorus]
When the world tried to tear us apart
We found strength in the rhythm of our hearts
No fire could break what we built so strong

[Chorus]
We made it through the fire, hand in hand
Proving that true love can withstand
Every test, every storm, every burning desire
We walked through the ashes, rose from the mire
We made it through the fire, you and I
And nothing in this world can make us say goodbye

[Bridge]
If the flames rise again, we’ll stand our ground
With you, I’m unshaken, forever bound
Through the heat, through the pain, we’ll survive
Our love is the flame that keeps us alive

[Final Chorus]
We made it through the fire, hand in hand
Proving that true love can withstand
Every test, every storm, every burning desire
We walked through the ashes, rose from the mire
We made it through the fire, you and I
And nothing in this world can make us say goodbye
