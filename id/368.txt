[Verse 1]
Roots run deep beneath the soil
Silent strength that does not toil
Branches stretch to catch the sun
Connected whole, becoming one

[Verse 2]
Fruits that bloom in season’s grace
Born of care, not by our pace
A steady flow, a living line
From source unseen, the true vine

[Chorus]
I am held by roots I cannot see
Flowing life that carries me
Bound together, strong and fine
Alive within the true vine

[Verse 3]
Storms may come and winds may tear
But this bond remains aware
A constant pulse that won’t unwind
The endless strength of the true vine

[Chorus]
I am held by roots I cannot see
Flowing life that carries me
Bound together, strong and fine
Alive within the true vine

[Bridge]
No branch alone can bear the load
But joined as one, the pathway’s showed
In quiet growth, the fruit is mine
Drawn from life within the vine

[Final Chorus]
I am held by roots I cannot see
Flowing life that carries me
Bound together, strong and fine
Alive within the true vine
