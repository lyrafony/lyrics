[Verse 1]
Behind the smile, a shadow hides
Words like silk, but truth divides
Empty hands that grasp for more
Feeding lies behind closed doors

[Verse 2]
Promises sold with silver tongues
Counting coins while prayers are sung
False shepherds leading blind
Leaving hope and hearts confined

[Chorus]
Masks of greed, worn with pride
Hiding truth, casting lies
False prophets’ empty creed
Blinded by their own deceit

[Verse 3]
But beneath the gilded face
Lies a soul devoid of grace
Justice waits to claim its due
The veil will lift, the false fall through

[Chorus]
Masks of greed, worn with pride
Hiding truth, casting lies
False prophets’ empty creed
Blinded by their own deceit

[Bridge]
The day will come when all is known
When truth stands tall on justice’s throne
No mask can hide the heart’s intent
The falsehoods fade, the end is sent

[Final Chorus]
Masks of greed, worn with pride
Hiding truth, casting lies
False prophets’ empty creed
Blinded by their own deceit
