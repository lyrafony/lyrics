[Intro]
You wore a smile, but it was all a lie,
Hiding the truth with every word, every sigh.
Behind your mask, I couldn’t see,
The venomous heart that was poisoning me.

[Verso 1]
You called yourself a friend, a partner, a guide,
But your true face, you chose to hide.
Your kindness was fake, your love a charade,
All the while, my trust you betrayed.

[Pre-Coro]
I gave you my heart, I gave you my trust,
But now I see clearly, it was all just dust.
A mask you wore, a face so sweet,
But the truth was poison that you’d discreet.

[Coro]
False faces, lies in disguise,
You fooled me once, but now I realize.
Behind your eyes, nothing was real,
A mask so perfect, it made me kneel.

[Verso 2]
You tore me down with a smile so bright,
Blinded by your charm, I lost the fight.
But now I see, now I know,
The truth you hid, the lies you sow.

[Puente]
No more deceiving, no more pretending,
The mask has fallen, no more defending.
I’m done with the lies, I’m done with the game,
You’re nothing but ashes, and I’ll never be the same.

[Coro]
False faces, lies in disguise,
You fooled me once, but now I realize.
Behind your eyes, nothing was real,
A mask so perfect, it made me kneel.
