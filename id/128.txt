[Verse 1]
I’ve been knocked down, I’ve felt the pain,
but I won’t break, I’ll rise again.
The road was long, the night was cold,
but now I’m standing, strong and bold.

[Pre-Chorus]
They tried to silence my voice,
but I found the strength to make my choice.
Through the fire, through the rain,
I’ll rise again, I’ll break these chains!

[Chorus]
I will rise again, higher than before,
stronger than the storm, I’ll roar!
I’ll rise again, I’ll make my stand,
with every step, I’ll take command!

[Verse 2]
The scars I carry, they tell my story,
of battles fought, of lost glory.
But I won’t let the past define,
I’m moving forward, I’m gonna shine!

[Pre-Chorus]
They tried to silence my voice,
but I found the strength to make my choice.
Through the fire, through the rain,
I’ll rise again, I’ll break these chains!

[Chorus]
I will rise again, higher than before,
stronger than the storm, I’ll roar!
I’ll rise again, I’ll make my stand,
with every step, I’ll take command!

[Bridge]
Every fall, every tear,
brought me closer to being here.
Now I’m free, now I’m strong,
I’ve found my place where I belong!

[Final Chorus]
I will rise again, higher than before,
stronger than the storm, I’ll roar!
I’ll rise again, I’ll make my stand,
with every step, I’ll take command!
