[Verse 1]
I look in the glass, but I don’t see me,
The cracks in the surface, where I used to be.
The reflection is blurry, distorted, unclear,
A face that was whole, now shattered with fear.
I hear your voice, but it′s fading away,
The love we once had is nothing but gray.
The pieces we broke are scattered around,
But I can’t find myself, I’m lost and I’m bound.

[Chorus]
Broken mirrors on the floor,
What’s left of me, I can’t ignore.
All that we built is now destroyed,
A love once perfect, now paranoid.
I can’t piece together the cracks in my soul,
I’m staring at a face I don’t even know.
Broken mirrors, can’t you see?
I’m lost in the shards, trying to find me.

[Verse 2]
I see the past, it’s like a ghost,
Fading slowly, but it hurts the most.
The dreams we built are falling apart,
Like a broken mirror, we drifted so far.
I wish I could fix it, put it all right,
But the cracks keep spreading, and I lose sight.
You’re not here, and it’s hard to let go,
I’m still picking up pieces of what I used to know.

[Chorus]
Broken mirrors on the floor,
What’s left of me, I can’t ignore.
All that we built is now destroyed,
A love once perfect, now paranoid.
I can’t piece together the cracks in my soul,
I’m staring at a face I don’t even know.
Broken mirrors, can’t you see?
I’m lost in the shards, trying to find me.

[Bridge]
I tried to hold on, I tried to mend,
But some things break that never end.
Now I’m just fragments, scattered and torn,
A love once shining, now forlorn.
I’m walking through pieces of who I was,
Trying to fix this, but lost in the dust.

[Chorus]
Broken mirrors on the floor,
What’s left of me, I can’t ignore.
All that we built is now destroyed,
A love once perfect, now paranoid.
I can’t piece together the cracks in my soul,
I’m staring at a face I don’t even know.
Broken mirrors, can’t you see?
I’m lost in the shards, trying to find me.

[Outro]
Broken mirrors, broken dreams,
I’m stuck in the silence, lost in the seams.
