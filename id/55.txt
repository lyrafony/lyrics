Verse 1
I bought myself flowers, I took myself out,
No need for validation or cleaning up doubts.
I know my quirks, I love my flaws,
I don’t need applause—I write my own laws.

Pre-Chorus
I’m the queen of my world, I’m the star of my show,
Why settle for less when I already glow?
No drama, no games, just me and my mind,
I’m the perfect partner I’ve been trying to find.

Chorus
I’m dating myself, it’s a love supreme,
No one knows me better than me, it seems.
I bring the joy, I bring the fun,
I’m my own number one.
I’m dating myself, yeah, I’m doing just fine,
No bad vibes, no wasted time.
I’m enough, I’m complete,
My heart’s off the market—it’s mine to keep.

Verse 2
I cook my own meals, I dance in my room,
No one tells me when to bloom.
I laugh at my jokes, I cry when I need,
I’m the only one who truly gets me.

Pre-Chorus
You can try to impress, but you’ll never compare,
To the love and respect that I give myself there.
I’m not waiting around for someone to save,
I’m my own hero, I’m brave.

Chorus
I’m dating myself, it’s a love supreme,
No one knows me better than me, it seems.
I bring the joy, I bring the fun,
I’m my own number one.
I’m dating myself, yeah, I’m doing just fine,
No bad vibes, no wasted time.
I’m enough, I’m complete,
My heart’s off the market—it’s mine to keep.
