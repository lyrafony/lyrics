[Verse]
Falling through time, I lose my name,
Colors dissolve, no one to blame.
A quiet pull, a distant sound,
Drifting further from the ground.

[Chorus]
Take me higher, let me see,
The endless waves of eternity.
Every heartbeat fades to dust,
But love remains, it’s still enough.

[Verse]
Shadows stretch, they call my soul,
Through empty halls where memories roll.
I’m not afraid, I’m not alone,
The universe whispers, “You’re home.”

[Bridge]
Ohhh… ohhh…
Floating free in an endless sea…
Ohhh… ohhh…
Time is just a melody…

[Outro]
We fade, we shine, we intertwine,
Dreams and shadows crossing the line.
In this moment, we are whole,
Forever searching, forever bold.
