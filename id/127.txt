Title: Chasing Shadows

[Verse 1]
I’m running through the night,
lost in thoughts I can’t deny.
Searching for a sign, a spark,
but I’m blinded by the dark.

[Pre-Chorus]
I can’t tell what’s real or fake,
every move I make is a mistake.
I keep chasing what’s out of sight,
but every shadow fades with light.

[Chorus]
I’m chasing shadows, chasing dreams,
but nothing’s ever as it seems.
Fighting battles in my mind,
I’m lost and running out of time.

[Verse 2]
I’ve seen the truth, it slipped away,
just like the words I couldn’t say.
The more I try to make it right,
the further I drift from the light.

[Pre-Chorus]
I can’t tell what’s real or fake,
every move I make is a mistake.
I keep chasing what’s out of sight,
but every shadow fades with light.

[Chorus]
I’m chasing shadows, chasing dreams,
but nothing’s ever as it seems.
Fighting battles in my mind,
I’m lost and running out of time.

[Bridge]
I thought I knew the way,
but every step just led me astray.
I’m holding on, but slipping through,
can’t find the answer, can’t find you.

[Final Chorus]
I’m chasing shadows, chasing dreams,
but nothing’s ever as it seems.
Fighting battles in my mind,
I’m lost and running out of time.
