[Intro]
Feel the pull…
You know you want it…

[Verse 1]
I saw you from across the room, your aura shines so bright
Every move you make, it’s like a flame ignites
I can’t look away, I’m caught up in your spell
Your eyes are magnetic, got me under your shell

The night is young, but the tension’s growing fast
Every glance you throw is pulling me in tight
This chemistry’s insane, I can’t deny the vibe
We’re both aware, but we’re playing with fire

[Pre-Chorus]
It’s getting hot, can’t you feel the heat?
Our bodies closer, hearts about to meet
No need to rush, but we’re losing control
Baby, this is taking its toll

[Chorus]
Temptation, pulling me closer
I can’t resist, I need you over
Every touch sends shivers down my spine
Caught in the moment, this feels so fine
Temptation, lighting up the air
Can’t fight it now, I don’t even care
You’re my desire, my guilty pleasure
Let’s give in, let’s take this treasure

[Verse 2]
The bass is pounding loud, it matches our heartbeat
Each step we take brings us closer to defeat
Your hands on mine, electric like a storm
This connection’s wild, it’s breaking every norm

We’re dancing in the dark, no rules to define
Just raw emotion, your body pressed to mine
I know it’s dangerous, but I’m ready to fall
Tonight we’ll leave it all behind, answer the call

[Pre-Chorus]
It’s getting hot, can’t you feel the heat?
Our bodies closer, hearts about to meet
No need to rush, but we’re losing control
Baby, this is taking its toll

[Chorus]
Temptation, pulling me closer
I can’t resist, I need you over
Every touch sends shivers down my spine
Caught in the moment, this feels so fine
Temptation, lighting up the air
Can’t fight it now, I don’t even care
You’re my desire, my guilty pleasure
Let’s give in, let’s take this treasure

[Bridge]
The night is ours, no limits tonight
We’re crossing lines, into the light
No turning back, we’ve come too far
Together we burn like a shooting star

[Final Chorus]
Temptation, pulling me closer
I can’t resist, I need you over
Every touch sends shivers down my spine
Caught in the moment, this feels so fine
Temptation, lighting up the air
Can’t fight it now, I don’t even care
You’re my desire, my guilty pleasure
Let’s give in, let’s take this treasure

[Outro]
Feel it… burning inside…
