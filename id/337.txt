[Verse]
The echoes call, they never die,
A broken system beneath the sky.
It whispers lies, it feeds my mind,
I search for truth but never find.

[Chorus]
Echoes of a broken system, loud and clear,
The lies they tell, they’re all I hear.
A fractured world, too far to mend,
Echoes of a broken system that never ends.

[Verse]
The lights flicker, the walls they crack,
I chase the truth but it’s out of track.
Every step I take leads to the same,
A broken system, no one’s to blame.

[Chorus]
Echoes of a broken system, loud and clear,
The lies they tell, they’re all I hear.
A fractured world, too far to mend,
Echoes of a broken system that never ends.

[Bridge]
I hear the whispers, I feel the burn,
A system built to twist and turn.
But in the silence, I can’t ignore,
The echoes scream, I’m lost once more.

[Chorus]
Echoes of a broken system, loud and clear,
The lies they tell, they’re all I hear.
A fractured world, too far to mend,
Echoes of a broken system that never ends.

[Outro]
I’ll walk through the noise, I’ll find my way,
But the echoes will follow, day by day.
