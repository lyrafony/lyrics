[Verse 1]
Winds rage loud inside my chest
A tempest pounding without rest
The storm within will not relent
A clash of doubt and deep intent

[Verse 2]
Dark clouds gather, lightning strikes
Between the wrongs and all the rights
The battle rages, fierce and wild
A war inside, both fierce and mild

[Chorus]
Storm within, I fight to stand
Caught between the sea and land
Though thunder roars and shadows spin
I hold the calm that lies within

[Verse 3]
The fight is long, the night is deep
Yet in the chaos, faith will keep
A fragile hope that wonâ€™t give in
The quiet strength beneath the din

[Chorus]
Storm within, I fight to stand
Caught between the sea and land
Though thunder roars and shadows spin
I hold the calm that lies within

[Bridge]
Through crashing waves and howling wind
I find the peace that dwells within
And when the tempest starts to cease
I grasp the stillness, find release

[Final Chorus]
Storm within, I fight to stand
Caught between the sea and land
Though thunder roars and shadows spin
I hold the calm that lies within
