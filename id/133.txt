[Intro]
Feel it…
The energy’s here…

[Verse 1]
The night is buzzing, can’t you feel it too?
Every heartbeat matches the rhythm we move to
No need for words, the vibe speaks loud
We’re riding the wave, no place for doubts

The stars align, the moment’s clear
This magic between us pulls us near
It’s in the air, it’s everywhere
A perfect symphony we both share

[Pre-Chorus]
Let it flow, let it guide you
Close your eyes, don’t you fight it
Feel the pulse, let it take hold
Baby, this is pure gold

[Chorus]
Vibes in the air, they’re taking us high
No limits tonight, just you and I
Feel the rhythm, let it steer
This moment’s ours, hold it dear
Vibes in the air, they’re lighting the way
Dancing through the night, come what may
No stress, no fear, just the sound
Together we rise, we’re unbound

[Verse 2]
The DJ spins the track, the bassline hums
Our feet keep moving as the energy drums
Every step we take feels like a dream
Lost in the moment, nothing’s as it seems

The world fades out, it’s just us now
No past, no future, only the now
These vibes are alive, they’re running wild
Two souls connected, heart to heart, reconciled

[Pre-Chorus]
Let it flow, let it guide you
Close your eyes, don’t you fight it
Feel the pulse, let it take hold
Baby, this is pure gold

[Chorus]
Vibes in the air, they’re taking us high
No limits tonight, just you and I
Feel the rhythm, let it steer
This moment’s ours, hold it dear
Vibes in the air, they’re lighting the way
Dancing through the night, come what may
No stress, no fear, just the sound
Together we rise, we’re unbound

[Bridge]
Ooooh…
Feel the energy rise, it’s electric
We’re floating higher, no limits
The night is endless, no end in sight
Just hold me close, feel the light

[Final Chorus]
Vibes in the air, they’re taking us high
No limits tonight, just you and I
Feel the rhythm, let it steer
This moment’s ours, hold it dear
Vibes in the air, they’re lighting the way
Dancing through the night, come what may
No stress, no fear, just the sound
Together we rise, we’re unbound
