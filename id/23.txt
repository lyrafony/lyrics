(Verso 1)
The moment when our eyes collide across the room
The second when my heart beats louder than the tune
The way you smile, I swear I’ve seen it in a dream
Is this real or just a scene from some movie screen?

(Pre-Coro)
We could take it slow, but why should we wait?
When the fire’s lit, let it turn into flames
Hands reaching out, don’t let this escape
Baby, what’s the delay?

(Coro)
Can you feel the magic rising?
Now we, now we’re losing control
Now we, now we’re losing control
Love at first sight, it’s love at first sight
Pull me closer, no more hiding
No more, no more taking it slow
No more, no more taking it slow
Love at first sight, it's love at first sight

(Post-Coro)
Lo-lo-lo-lo-love
Lo-lo-love at first sight
Lo-lo-lo-lo-love
Lo-lo-love at first sight

(Verso 2)
I want you like the stars want the midnight sky
I need you like the waves chase the high tide
One look, one touch, now I’m hypnotized
No going back, it’s you and I tonight

(Pre-Coro)
We could take it slow, but why should we wait?
When the fire’s lit, let it turn into flames
Hands reaching out, don’t let this escape
Baby, what’s the delay?

(Coro)
Can you feel the magic rising?
Now we, now we’re losing control
Now we, now we’re losing control
Love at first sight, it’s love at first sight
Pull me closer, no more hiding
No more, no more taking it slow
No more, no more taking it slow
Love at first sight, it's love at first sight

(Bridge)
Oh-oh, baby, can’t deny it
Oh-oh, we don’t have to fight it
Oh-oh, tell me you can feel it too
Tell me you can feel it too

(Coro - Variación)
Can you feel the magic rising?
Now we, now we’re losing control
Now we, now we’re losing control
Love at first sight, it’s love at first sight
Pull me closer, no more hiding
No more, no more taking it slow
No more, no more taking it slow
Love at first sight, it's love at first sight

(Outro - Repetitivo con fade out)
Lo-lo-lo-lo-love
Lo-lo-love at first sight
Lo-lo-lo-lo-love
Lo-lo-love at first sight
