[Verse 1]
No cheers behind, no guiding crowd
Just steady steps, no voice too loud
The road is hard, the night is long
But in my heart, I hear the song

[Verse 2]
Though winds may howl and doubts may rise
I fix my gaze beyond the skies
No crown to win, no throne to claim
Just silent love that knows no shame

[Chorus]
Still I follow, through the fire
Through the trials and the mire
Though the way is rough and steep
In this path, my soul will keep

[Verse 3]
No turning back, no fear or fall
Just one small step that conquers all
The journeyâ€™s long, the price is high
But still I walk beneath the sky

[Chorus]
Still I follow, through the fire
Through the trials and the mire
Though the way is rough and steep
In this path, my soul will keep

[Bridge]
No promise made, no crowd to see
Just faith that moves inside of me
A quiet call, a whispered plea
Still I follow faithfully

[Final Chorus]
Still I follow, through the fire
Through the trials and the mire
Though the way is rough and steep
In this path, my soul will keep
