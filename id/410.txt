[Verse 1]
Woven strands beyond the sight
Threads of covenant, pure light
Binding souls through endless time
A sacred pact, a whispered rhyme

[Verse 2]
Invisible hands entwine
Promises that still align
Through storms fierce and shadows long
The bond endures, steadfast and strong

[Chorus]
Threads of covenant, holding fast
A link that’s forged to ever last
Through trials deep and seasons cold
A faith renewed, a hand to hold

[Verse 3]
In quiet moments, hearts recall
The sacred vow that binds us all
No force of earth can break or sever
The timeless bond that lasts forever

[Chorus]
Threads of covenant, holding fast
A link that’s forged to ever last
Through trials deep and seasons cold
A faith renewed, a hand to hold

[Bridge]
Though winds may blow and tides may turn
The covenant will never burn
A light that shines through darkest night
Guiding all to truth and light

[Final Chorus]
Threads of covenant, holding fast
A link that’s forged to ever last
Through trials deep and seasons cold
A faith renewed, a hand to hold
