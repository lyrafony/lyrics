[Verse 1]
They say stay low, keep it tight,
But I’m drawn to the edge of the night.
Rules don’t bind me, I’m breaking free,
This forbidden fire owns me.

[Pre-Chorus]
Every heartbeat pulls me near,
To a world they’ll never hear.
The closer I get, the more I see,
A love too wild to simply be.

[Chorus]
Edge of desire, I’m losing control,
A reckless heart, a burning soul.
I’ll cross the line, I’ll pay the price,
For one more taste of paradise.

[Verse 2]
The whispers call, they lead me blind,
To a place where shadows unwind.
No fear remains, no chains to hold,
Just the truth of this love untold.

[Pre-Chorus]
Every heartbeat pulls me near,
To a world they’ll never hear.
The closer I get, the more I see,
A love too wild to simply be.

[Chorus]
Edge of desire, I’m losing control,
A reckless heart, a burning soul.
I’ll cross the line, I’ll pay the price,
For one more taste of paradise.

[Bridge]
If they knew the fire inside,
Would they try to turn the tide?
But I’ve made my choice, I won’t retreat,
This love’s a flame I can’t defeat.

[Chorus]
Edge of desire, I’m losing control,
A reckless heart, a burning soul.
I’ll cross the line, I’ll pay the price,
For one more taste of paradise.

[Outro]
Edge of desire, forever I’ll roam,
In the dark, I’ve found my home.
No chains, no lies, just you and me,
A love unbound, eternally.
