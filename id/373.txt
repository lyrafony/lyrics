[Verse 1]
A quiet stream begins to flow
From hidden springs we’ll never know
It winds through valleys, soft and wide
A source of life that won’t divide

[Verse 2]
Its waters clear, its current strong
A healing song, a gentle song
It cleanses all, it calls the lost
No matter what the final cost

[Chorus]
The river of life, forever pure
A flowing grace that will endure
From source unseen, it never ends
A timeless gift that life extends

[Verse 3]
Through deserts dry and barren lands
It brings new hope with open hands
A stream that flows beyond all time
The endless flow, the sacred rhyme

[Chorus]
The river of life, forever pure
A flowing grace that will endure
From source unseen, it never ends
A timeless gift that life extends

[Bridge]
No drought can touch this living stream
It carries more than we can dream
A quiet flood that fills the soul
And makes the broken pieces whole

[Final Chorus]
The river of life, forever pure
A flowing grace that will endure
From source unseen, it never ends
A timeless gift that life extends
