Title: Through the Broken Glass

[Verse 1]
I look through the broken glass,
The pieces fall, they shatter fast.
A fractured world, a fractured mind,
I see the truth, but it’s hard to find.

[Verse 2]
The colors fade, the edges blur,
I can’t remember what was once sure.
The glass reflects a twisted view,
A world that’s broken, just like me too.

[Bridge]
The voices whisper, but they don’t speak,
The answers hide in shadows, weak.
I reach for them, but they slip away,
A broken mirror that leads me astray.

[Chorus]
Through the broken glass, I can see it all,
A world collapsing, bound to fall.
But I stand tall, I won’t look back,
Through the broken glass, I’ll find my track.

[Outro]
The glass is sharp, the pieces cut,
But I’ll keep walking, through the rut.
A fractured world, a shattered past,
Through the broken glass, I’ll make it last.
