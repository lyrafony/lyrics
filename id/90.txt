[Verse 1]
I’m piecing back the fragments,
Of a heart that’s torn in two.
Each shard cuts deep, it never mends,
But somehow, I must make it through.
The echoes linger in the air,
A ghost of what we used to share.
Yet even broken, I still breathe,
This pain won’t define who I’ll be.

[Pre-Chorus]
It feels like drowning in an endless sea,
Every wave pulls you further from me.
But beneath the weight of all this pain,
There’s a spark that can rise again.

[Chorus]
I’ll rebuild from the ashes, one step at a time,
Though the scars will remain, they’re reminders I’m alive.
Every tear is a brick in the walls I restore,
Every wound makes my spirit stronger than before.
I’ll rise with the fire, let it guide where I go,
Through the ruins, I’ll find the strength to grow.

[Verse 2]
The silence screams where laughter lived,
An empty space I can’t erase.
But slowly now, I start to give,
To hope instead of fear’s embrace.
The colors fade, but not for long,
A melody begins its song.
And though it hurts, I’ll face the truth—
Even loss brings new roots.

[Pre-Chorus]
It feels like drowning in an endless sea,
Every wave pulls you further from me.
But beneath the weight of all this pain,
There’s a spark that can rise again.

[Chorus]
I’ll rebuild from the ashes, one step at a time,
Though the scars will remain, they’re reminders I’m alive.
Every tear is a brick in the walls I restore,
Every wound makes my spirit stronger than before.
I’ll rise with the fire, let it guide where I go,
Through the ruins, I’ll find the strength to grow.

[Bridge]
Maybe losing isn’t truly gone,
Maybe love lives on and on.
In every memory, in every sigh,
Their light still shines within my sky.
So I’ll take the pieces, no matter how small,
And build a future from it all.

[Outro]
From the ashes, I’ll rise anew,
With every heartbeat, I’ll see it through.
The past may shape, but won’t confine,
For in these ruins, I’ll redefine.
I’ll rebuild, I’ll survive, I’ll grow…
Through the pain, I’ll let love show.
