[Intro]
Hollow words in a hollow shrine,
Empty hymns for the endless line.
Raise your voice, but it fades to dust,
No truth remains—just promises rust.

[Verse 1]
They sing their songs, but the notes are fake,
A masquerade for the hearts they take.
Gold-plated lies on a crumbling throne,
The echoes fade, leaving us alone.

[Pre-Chorus]
I won’t bow to shadows dressed as light,
No more silence—I’ll ignite the fight.

[Chorus]
Empty hymns ring out in the night,
False gods falling from their height.
I’ll tear the veil, expose the lie,
No more chains—I’ve said goodbye.

[Verse 2]
Their temples crumble, their voices wane,
Built on whispers of fleeting gain.
But I see through the smoke, the mirror’s cracked,
The system shatters where dreams are stacked.

[Pre-Chorus]
I won’t bow to shadows dressed as light,
No more silence—I’ll ignite the fight.

[Chorus]
Empty hymns ring out in the night,
False gods falling from their height.
I’ll tear the veil, expose the lie,
No more chains—I’ve said goodbye.

[Bridge]
Let the idols fall, let the altars burn,
From the ashes rises what we yearn.
Truth is a fire that refuses to die,
We’ll build anew beneath the sky.

[Final Chorus]
Empty hymns will fade into the void,
No more worship for what’s destroyed.
I’ll write my own song, break the mold,
A hymn of life, pure as gold.
