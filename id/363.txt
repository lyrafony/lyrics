[Opening]
Blooming bright in poisoned air,
Roots of dust, dreams of despair.

[Verse]
Ghost gardens under burning skies,
Hope is born and hope still dies.
Watered by forgotten tears,
Fading in the heat of fears.

[Pre-Chorus]
Every color, a trick of light,
Every flower, a fleeting fight.

[Chorus]
Mirage bloom, sweet and fake,
Shatter me before I wake.
Petals fall in silent doom,
Chasing you, Mirage Bloom.

[Breakdown]
Breathe the dust, swallow the sun,
Still I chase what canâ€²t be won.

[Chorus]
Mirage bloom, sweet and fake,
Shatter me before I wake.
Petals fall in silent doom,
Chasing you, Mirage Bloom.

[Outro]
One more step into the gloom,
One more dream, Mirage Bloom.
