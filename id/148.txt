[Intro]
Streetlights flicker, hear the echoes call…

[Verse 1]
Ain’t no mercy where the wolves still bite,
Ain’t no sleep when you livin’ in the fight.
Trust no man, keep my back to the wall,
One false move, then you dead by the fall.

Came from the trenches where the lost ones stay,
Names in the wind, they just fade away.
Tryna stack mine ‘fore the clock runs dry,
But the game don’t change, only numbers lie.

[Pre-Chorus]
Cold steel, cold heart, no second chance,
One wrong word, now you caught in a dance.
Shadow moves, hear the whispers creep,
Ain’t no love in these city streets.

[Chorus]
No forgiveness, no way back,
One step wrong and the sky turns black.
Tryna break free but the past don’t fade,
One more night in the war we made.

[Verse 2]
Every scar on my skin tells a chapter of pain,
Every ghost in my mind got a face, got a name.
Been through the fire, walked through the smoke,
Buried my brothers, I ain′t tryna be next to go.

Street life ruthless, death move quick,
Bullet got no name but it’s always pickin’.
Made my bed, now I lay with the sins,
Pray for a way out, but I ain’t givin’ in.

[Pre-Chorus]
Cold steel, cold heart, no second chance,
One wrong word, now you caught in a dance.
Shadow moves, hear the whispers creep,
Ain’t no love in these city streets.

[Chorus]
No forgiveness, no way back,
One step wrong and the sky turns black.
Tryna break free but the past don’t fade,
One more night in the war we made.

[Bridge]
No angels, no saviors, just the sound of fate,
Footsteps echo, but it’s always too late.

[Verse 3]
Maybe I was built for the dark, no light,
Maybe I was meant for the war, no flight.
Maybe some souls just don’t get saved,
Trapped in the cycle ‘til we meet our grave.

[Outro]
Streetlights flicker, hear the echoes call…
