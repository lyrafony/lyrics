[Verse 1]
I walked barefoot through the flames they set,
No shoes to shield me, no regrets.
The heat was blinding, but I kept my pace,
Because the fire couldn’t burn what I’d already faced.

[Pre-Chorus]
They lit the match, but I own the blaze,
Turning their hatred into my praise.
Every step I take leaves a trail of sparks,
Barefoot in the fire, I’m leaving my marks.

[Chorus]
Barefoot in the fire, I’ll never back down,
Every step I take is sacred ground.
The flames may roar, but they’ll never win,
Barefoot in the fire, I’ll rise again.

[Verse 2]
The smoke fills my lungs, but I breathe it in,
Letting the ashes wash away my sin.
This fire is freedom; it’s breaking my chains,
Burning away the person I used to contain.

[Pre-Chorus]
They lit the match, but I own the blaze,
Turning their hatred into my praise.
Every step I take leaves a trail of sparks,
Barefoot in the fire, I’m leaving my marks.

[Chorus]
Barefoot in the fire, I’ll never back down,
Every step I take is sacred ground.
The flames may roar, but they’ll never win,
Barefoot in the fire, I’ll rise again.

[Bridge]
Oh, the fire tried to consume my soul,
But I turned the heat into something whole.
This barefoot heart is forged in flame,
And I’ll wear the scars like a warrior’s name.

[Final Section]
Barefoot in the fire, I’ll never break,
Every step I take is a leap of faith.
The flames can’t hurt me; they’re part of my art,
Barefoot in the fire, I’ve found my heart.
