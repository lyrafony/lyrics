[Verse 1]
The wind knows my name, but it speaks it low
Sand in my mouth, and nowhere to go
I′ve wandered far with a hollow chest
Carrying questions I never confessed

[Verse 2]
My prayers return like echoes to stone
No fire by night, no sign, no tone
I bleed in silence, I choke on doubt
If someone hears, they don′t cry out

[Chorus]
But somehow I’m breathing
Somehow I’m still standing
Something unseen keeps pulling me through
No map in my hand
No strength left to plan
Yet there′s a path where the light breaks through
I’m not alone in the desert
Even if I never knew

[Verse 3]
I’ve cursed the sky, I’ve begged the ground
But mercy came where none was found
No flash of gold, no thunder scream
Just peace that wrapped around my grief

[Chorus]
And somehow I’m breathing
Somehow I’m still standing
Something unseen keeps pulling me through
No map in my hand
No strength left to plan
Yet there′s a path where the light breaks through
I’m not alone in the desert
Even if I never knew

[Bridge]
Maybe it′s love I never earned
Maybe it′s grace I never learned
A whisper walks beside my fear
Too quiet to explain, too strong to disappear

[Final Chorus]
Still I’m breathing
Still I’m standing
What held me up was never me
No stars in the sky
But I’ve seen the signs
In places no one else could see
I was never alone in the desert
Though I thought it was just me
