(Verse 1)
I’ve spent too long looking for love in the wrong places
Lost in the crowd, chasing all the empty faces
But now I see, it’s time to stop and breathe
I’ve got to take a moment just for me

(Pre-Chorus)
No more waiting on someone to complete me
I’m learning how to love the person I see
I don’t need validation, I don’t need the rush
I’m holding onto me, it’s more than enough

(Chorus)
Me first, before anyone else
I’ve got to love myself, it’s time to heal
Me first, no more feeling small
I’m standing tall, I’m giving it my all
Me first, I’ve got my own back
I’m building up, I’m on the right track
Me first, I’m taking control
Loving myself, body, mind, and soul

(Verse 2)
I used to be afraid of standing alone
But now I know, this heart is my own
I’ve been through the storm, now I’m holding tight
I’m finding peace in my own light

(Pre-Chorus)
No more waiting on someone to complete me
I’m learning how to love the person I see
I don’t need validation, I don’t need the rush
I’m holding onto me, it’s more than enough

(Chorus)
Me first, before anyone else
I’ve got to love myself, it’s time to heal
Me first, no more feeling small
I’m standing tall, I’m giving it my all
Me first, I’ve got my own back
I’m building up, I’m on the right track
Me first, I’m taking control
Loving myself, body, mind, and soul

(Bridge)
I don’t need a crown to know my worth
I’m finding my power, here on this earth
I’ve learned to fall in love with the skin I’m in
It’s a journey, but I’m ready to begin

(Chorus - Variation)
Me first, before anyone else
I’ve got to love myself, it’s time to heal
Me first, no more feeling small
I’m standing tall, I’m giving it my all
Me first, I’ve got my own back
I’m building up, I’m on the right track
Me first, I’m taking control
Loving myself, body, mind, and soul

(Outro)
Me first, I’m choosing me
I’m strong enough to just let it be
Me first, before anyone else
I’m loving myself, and that’s my wealth
