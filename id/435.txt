[Verse 1]
I walked away from louder things
The cheers, the lights, the golden rings
No stage, no fame, no polished face
Just silence in a secret place

[Verse 2]
No one claps when pride is torn
When self is buried, not adorned
No trophies for the dying fight
That happens deep and out of sight

[Chorus]
No one claps, but still I go
Through fire that no crowd will know
The loudest change makes no parade
But in the dark, foundations laid

[Verse 3]
Each small “yes” that no one sees
Each private war down on my knees
These are the stones, the hidden flame
That build a soul without a name

[Chorus]
No one claps, but still I go
Through fire that no crowd will know
The loudest change makes no parade
But in the dark, foundations laid

[Bridge]
Let others chase what fades with night
I’ll trade applause for quiet light
Where secret roots grow deep and true
And only One can see them through

[Final Chorus]
No one claps, but still I go
Through fire that no crowd will know
I’ve left the stage, but found the way
Where silence shapes what won’t decay
