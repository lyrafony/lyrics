[Intro]
No matter where I go, I always find my way back to you
It’s like the clock resets every time I’m with you

[Verse 1]
I try to walk away, but my heart won’t let me
Every road I take leads right back to where we used to be
The memories replay, they’re stuck inside my mind
Even when you’re gone, your love is all I find

[Pre-Chorus]
Time moves forward, but I’m spinning in place
Trapped in this moment, I can’t erase
Your touch, your voice, the way you hold me tight

[Chorus]
I’m stuck in an infinite loop with you
Every start begins and ends where we knew
No matter how far I drift, I’ll return to your arms tonight
I’m caught in an infinite loop, it’s true
With you, there’s no escape, and I don’t wanna fight
This endless cycle keeps me alive

[Verse 2]
You’re the question and the answer too
Every thought I have is tied to you
The world may change, but this stays the same
In your orbit, I’ll forever remain

[Pre-Chorus]
Time moves forward, but I’m spinning in place
Trapped in this moment, I can’t erase
Your touch, your voice, the way you hold me tight

[Chorus]
I’m stuck in an infinite loop with you
Every start begins and ends where we knew
No matter how far I drift, I’ll return to your arms tonight
I’m caught in an infinite loop, it’s true
With you, there’s no escape, and I don’t wanna fight
This endless cycle keeps me alive

[Bridge]
If I could stop the hands of time
I’d freeze us here, you’d still be mine
But even if the clock runs out
I’ll circle back, there’s no doubt

[Final Chorus]
I’m stuck in an infinite loop with you
Every start begins and ends where we knew
No matter how far I drift, I’ll return to your arms tonight
I’m caught in an infinite loop, it’s true
With you, there’s no escape, and I don’t wanna fight
This endless cycle keeps me alive

[Outro]
Infinite loop…
Always back to you…
Never letting go…
