[Verse 1]
In the stillness of the night,
I hear your voice, though you’re out of sight.
Echoes of you, they linger on,
Even when the light of day is gone.
I close my eyes, but it’s still there,
The ghost of you, hanging in the air.

[Chorus]
Echoes of you, they won’t fade away,
Haunting my heart, every single day.
I try to move on, but you stay,
In the echoes of you, I’m lost, I’m astray.
Echoes of you, they call my name,
No matter how far, you’re always the same.

[Verse 2]
The world keeps turning, but I stay still,
Caught in the echoes, against my will.
Your laughter, your touch, they never leave,
Even though you’re gone, I can’t believe.
I reach for you, but you slip through,
All that’s left are the echoes of you.

[Chorus]
Echoes of you, they won’t fade away,
Haunting my heart, every single day.
I try to move on, but you stay,
In the echoes of you, I’m lost, I’m astray.
Echoes of you, they call my name,
No matter how far, you’re always the same.

[Bridge]
I hear your footsteps in the dark,
Like a shadow, you leave a mark.
I’ll never forget, no matter how I try,
Your echoes will never say goodbye.

[Chorus]
Echoes of you, they won’t fade away,
Haunting my heart, every single day.
I try to move on, but you stay,
In the echoes of you, I’m lost, I’m astray.
Echoes of you, they call my name,
No matter how far, you’re always the same.

[Outro]
Echoes of you, they linger on,
In the silence, you’re never gone.
