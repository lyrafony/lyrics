[Verse 1]
A breath that stirs the silent deep
Awakening souls from ancient sleep
Invisible winds that softly rise
Carrying hope beyond the skies

[Verse 2]
The pulse of life in every vein
A sacred force that will remain
Through trials fierce and seasons cold
The breath that heals, the strength untold

[Chorus]
Celestial breath, eternal flow
The life within that makes us whole
A whispered wind, a sacred fire
The spark that fuels our heart’s desire

[Verse 3]
No eye can see, yet all perceive
The touch that bids the soul believe
A holy gust that never fades
The living breath that lifts and saves

[Chorus]
Celestial breath, eternal flow
The life within that makes us whole
A whispered wind, a sacred fire
The spark that fuels our heart’s desire

[Bridge]
Through darkest night and brightest day
This breath sustains, will not decay
A source of grace, a guiding flame
Forevermore, the holy name

[Final Chorus]
Celestial breath, eternal flow
The life within that makes us whole
A whispered wind, a sacred fire
The spark that fuels our heart’s desire
