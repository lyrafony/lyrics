[Verse]
I’ve lost the light, I’ve lost my way,
Falling down, no words to say.
The weight of doubt pulls me low,
In the dark, I don’t know where to go.

[Chorus]
Falling from grace, I crash to the ground,
A shattered soul, no peace to be found.
But deep inside, there’s a flicker of light,
A spark that still burns through the endless night.

[Verse]
I’ve been here before, I know this pain,
The endless storm, the pouring rain.
But even as I fall apart,
I feel the strength in my broken heart.

[Chorus]
Falling from grace, I crash to the ground,
A shattered soul, no peace to be found.
But deep inside, there’s a flicker of light,
A spark that still burns through the endless night.

[Bridge]
I’ll rise from this fall, I’ll find my way,
In the ashes of yesterday.
With every scar, I learn to heal,
In this pain, I start to feel.

[Chorus]
Falling from grace, I crash to the ground,
A shattered soul, no peace to be found.
But deep inside, there’s a flicker of light,
A spark that still burns through the endless night.

[Outro]
I’ll find my grace, I’ll rise again,
From the depths, I’ll start to mend.
