Title: Ghosts in the Circuit

[Verse 1]
Wires hum like distant voices,
Echoes trapped in silent walls.
Neon ghosts, forgotten choices,
Fading names in endless halls.

I feel the static on my skin,
A pulse inside the metal stream.
Am I alive or just within
A fading, fractured, dying dream?

[Chorus]
Ghosts in the circuit, shadows in the code,
Flickering memories, lost on the road.
Ones and zeros, hollow and cold,
Drifting like echoes, stories untold.

[Verse 2]
Every thought is traced and stolen,
Every step a numbered file.
Freedom′s just a word left broken,
Buried deep in data piles.

Can you hear them calling out?
Glitches whisper through the air.
The past is lost, but full of doubt,
And I′m still searching—no one′s there.

[Chorus]
Ghosts in the circuit, shadows in the code,
Flickering memories, lost on the road.
Ones and zeros, hollow and cold,
Drifting like echoes, stories untold.

[Bridge]
Somewhere deep inside the wires,
A voice that sounds like mine.
Am I real or just a shadow,
Fading through the lines?

[Chorus]
Ghosts in the circuit, shadows in the code,
Flickering memories, lost on the road.
Ones and zeros, hollow and cold,
Drifting like echoes, stories untold.

[Outro]
Am I just a ghost? Am I just a thought?
Trapped in the circuit, forever lost.
