[Verse 1]
Static in the air, I feel the spark,
every touch, a lightning arc.
We don’t need words, just a glance,
pull me closer, let’s take the chance.

[Pre-Chorus]
Voltage rising, can’t slow down,
hearts are racing, hear the sound.
No resistance, no control,
we’re electrified, lose it all!

[Chorus]
Electric love, running through my veins,
one more touch, I’ll go insane!
High voltage, we can’t escape,
shock me now, don’t hesitate!

[Verse 2]
Fingers tracing neon lines,
lost in waves of flashing lights.
You and me, we burn too bright,
a circuit shorting in the night.

[Pre-Chorus]
Voltage rising, can’t slow down,
hearts are racing, hear the sound.
No resistance, no control,
we’re electrified, lose it all!

[Chorus]
Electric love, running through my veins,
one more touch, I’ll go insane!
High voltage, we can’t escape,
shock me now, don’t hesitate!

[Bridge]
Even if the lights burn out,
we’ll still shine, there’s no doubt.
Can’t unplug, can’t let go,
this love is all I know!

[Final Chorus]
Electric love, running through my veins,
one more touch, I’ll go insane!
High voltage, we can’t escape,
shock me now, don’t hesitate!
