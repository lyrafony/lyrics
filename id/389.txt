--

[Verse 1]
Silent voices call and sway
Promising riches, a brighter day
But beneath the shining gleam
Lurks the snare of a broken dream

[Verse 2]
Coins that clink in empty hands
Built on lies and shifting sands
False words wrapped in golden thread
Lead the lost where angels dread

[Chorus]
Whispers of gold, tempt and bind
Chains unseen that seize the mind
Empty promises, cold and old
Trapped within the whispers of gold

[Verse 3]
Greed’s sweet song, a siren’s call
Echoes deep through palace hall
But truth remains beyond the gleam
A steady light, a holy beam

[Chorus]
Whispers of gold, tempt and bind
Chains unseen that seize the mind
Empty promises, cold and old
Trapped within the whispers of gold

[Bridge]
Break the chains, see through the lies
Turn away from hollow skies
Seek the source beyond the mold
Free your soul from whispers of gold

[Final Chorus]
Whispers of gold, tempt and bind
Chains unseen that seize the mind
Empty promises, cold and old
Trapped within the whispers of gold
