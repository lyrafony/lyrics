Title: The search for belonging

[Verse 1]
I’ve wandered through crowds, yet felt so alone,
Searching for a place to call my own.
Every face I meet feels like a stranger’s mask,
A fleeting connection that never seems to last.
I’ve tried to fit where I don’t belong,
Forced smiles and words, but it all feels wrong.
Yet deep inside, there’s a quiet plea,
To find somewhere I’m accepted just being me.

[Pre-Chorus]
It’s hard to stand when you feel unseen,
When every door leads to another dream.
But maybe belonging isn’t a place or a name,
It’s finding the courage to stay the same.

[Chorus]
I’ll search for home in every heart I meet,
In every moment where souls compete.
Belonging isn’t given; it’s something we create,
A bond we build, a space we relate.
Through every trial, through every fight,
I’ll carve a circle bathed in light.
This is my journey, my sacred quest,
To find the tribe where I can truly rest.

[Verse 2]
The world keeps spinning, pulling me apart,
Leaving cracks in places meant for my heart.
I’ve built walls high to shield my core,
Afraid of rejection, afraid of more.
But love finds ways through even the tightest seams,
Binding hearts together with fragile dreams.
Perhaps the home I seek isn’t far away,
But rooted in how I choose to stay.

[Pre-Chorus]
It’s hard to stand when you feel unseen,
When every door leads to another dream.
But maybe belonging isn’t a place or a name,
It’s finding the courage to stay the same.

[Chorus]
I’ll search for home in every heart I meet,
In every moment where souls compete.
Belonging isn’t given; it’s something we create,
A bond we build, a space we relate.
Through every trial, through every fight,
I’ll carve a circle bathed in light.
This is my journey, my sacred quest,
To find the tribe where I can truly rest.
