[Verse 1]
Your hands trace lines on my skin,
Shadows linger, let them in.
In the dark, we lose our names,
Two souls entwined in secret flames.

[Pre-Chorus]
Every breath feels like a crime,
Yet I surrender every time.
The world outside begins to fade,
Only you remain, unafraid.

[Chorus]
Skin and shadows, we collide,
A love that burns from deep inside.
No light to guide, no rules to keep,
We’re dancing in the realms of sleep.

[Verse 2]
The air is heavy, thick with need,
Each touch fulfills a silent creed.
Our whispers echo through the night,
A symphony of wrong and right.

[Pre-Chorus]
Every breath feels like a crime,
Yet I surrender every time.
The world outside begins to fade,
Only you remain, unafraid.

[Chorus]
Skin and shadows, we collide,
A love that burns from deep inside.
No light to guide, no rules to keep,
We’re dancing in the realms of sleep.

[Bridge]
If they knew, they’d tear us apart,
But this fire lives within my heart.
Your shadow haunts my every move,
A love forbidden, yet so true.

[Chorus]
Skin and shadows, we collide,
A love that burns from deep inside.
No light to guide, no rules to keep,
We’re dancing in the realms of sleep.

[Outro]
Skin and shadows, soft and raw,
Breaking every sacred law.
In the silence, we’ll always stay,
Forever yours, come what may.
