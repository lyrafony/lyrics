--

[Verse 1]
Behind closed doors, the silence weighs
Heavy hearts in lonely days
Unseen tears and quiet pain
Carried deep, endured in vain

[Verse 2]
Voices loud in crowded rooms
Yet none reach through the silent tombs
Suffering hidden, burdens kept
In solitude, the spirit wept

[Chorus]
Silent burdens, worn alone
Hearts unseen, turned to stone
Help withheld, hands withdrawn
In shadows where the weary mourn

[Verse 3]
A whispered hope, a faint refrain
Longing for a hand to gain
But empty words and hollow stares
Leave souls trapped in deep despairs

[Chorus]
Silent burdens, worn alone
Hearts unseen, turned to stone
Help withheld, hands withdrawn
In shadows where the weary mourn

[Bridge]
Yet in the dark, a light remains
A promise strong through all the pains
To lift the weak, to heal the torn
And bring the dawn to those forlorn

[Final Chorus]
Silent burdens, worn alone
Hearts unseen, turned to stone
Help withheld, hands withdrawn
In shadows where the weary mourn
