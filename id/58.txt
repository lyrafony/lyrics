[Verse 1]
I hear them calling when the lights go down,
Whispers in the dark pulling me to drown.
Every step I take feels like walking through a storm,
But I won’t let them win, I’ll fight till I’m reborn.

[Pre-Chorus]
They’re always there, lurking in my mind,
But I’ve got fire in my veins, I’ll leave them all behind.
The shadows may haunt me, but they’ll never own me,
I’ll break these chains and finally be free.

[Chorus]
I’m fighting shadows in the dead of night,
Running from the darkness, chasing the light.
Every scar I carry tells me I’m alive,
This is my battle, this is my fight.

[Verse 2]
The mirror shows the cracks beneath my skin,
Battles fought in silence that no one sees within.
But every tear I shed is a spark in the flame,
And I’ll burn brighter than the shadows in my name.

[Pre-Chorus]
They’re always there, lurking in my mind,
But I’ve got fire in my veins, I’ll leave them all behind.
The shadows may haunt me, but they’ll never own me,
I’ll break these chains and finally be free.

[Chorus]
I’m fighting shadows in the dead of night,
Running from the darkness, chasing the light.
Every scar I carry tells me I’m alive,
This is my battle, this is my fight.

[Bridge]
Oh, they pull me under, try to steal my breath,
But I’ll rise from the ashes, conquer my death.
The war inside is loud, but I’ll find my way,
Through the pain and the shadows, I’ll see the day.

[Final Chorus]
I’m fighting shadows in the dead of night,
Running from the darkness, chasing the light.
Every scar I carry tells me I’m alive,
This is my battle, this is my fight.

[Outro]
The shadows may linger, but they’ll never win,
I’ll keep on fighting till the light breaks in.
