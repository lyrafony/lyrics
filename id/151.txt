[Verse 1]
I held on tight, but you slipped away,
Like sand through fingers, you couldn’t stay.
The warmth you gave has turned to cold,
And now I’m left with nothing to hold.
We built a life, but it fell apart,
I’m left with the ashes of a broken heart.

[Chorus]
Empty hands, empty dreams,
I’m drowning in the silent screams.
I reach for you, but you’re not there,
All I have is empty air.
What we had, now it’s gone,
I’m searching for you, but you’ve moved on.

[Verse 2]
I used to feel you beside me here,
Now I’m lost in the void, full of fear.
The love we shared is fading fast,
I’m holding on to a ghost from the past.
I tried to keep it, I tried to fight,
But I’m left alone in the dead of night.

[Chorus]
Empty hands, empty dreams,
I’m drowning in the silent screams.
I reach for you, but you’re not there,
All I have is empty air.
What we had, now it’s gone,
I’m searching for you, but you’ve moved on.

[Bridge]
I feel the weight of all that’s lost,
But I can’t find the way to pay the cost.
I thought you’d stay, but now you’re gone,
And I’m left with nothing to hold on.

[Outro]
Empty hands, empty heart,
I’m trying to heal, but it’s falling apart.
The silence lingers, a painful truth,
I’m just a memory of our youth.
