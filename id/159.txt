[Verse 1]
Beneath the silence, I hear your name,
A whisper in the wind, but it’s never the same.
I reach for you, but you’re out of sight,
All I’m left with is the fading light.
The promises we made, now long gone,
But I still wonder what went wrong.

[Chorus]
Beneath the silence, I’m still waiting,
For the love that’s gone, but I keep debating.
Should I move on or hold you tight?
Beneath the silence, I lose the fight.
I keep hoping, but I know the truth,
Beneath the silence, I still love you.

[Verse 2]
The nights are colder, the stars no longer shine,
I try to forget, but your love’s still mine.
I see your face in every place I go,
And I can’t let go, though I know I should know.
The silence is louder than it seems,
A world without you, just empty dreams.

[Chorus]
Beneath the silence, I’m still waiting,
For the love that’s gone, but I keep debating.
Should I move on or hold you tight?
Beneath the silence, I lose the fight.
I keep hoping, but I know the truth,
Beneath the silence, I still love you.

[Bridge]
Time doesn’t heal, it just fades the pain,
But beneath the silence, it’s still the same.
I’ll carry your memory, I’ll hold it close,
And beneath the silence, I’ll love you the most.

[Chorus]
Beneath the silence, I’m still waiting,
For the love that’s gone, but I keep debating.
Should I move on or hold you tight?
Beneath the silence, I lose the fight.
I keep hoping, but I know the truth,
Beneath the silence, I still love you.

[Outro]
Beneath the silence, I’ll never forget,
The love we had, the love we lost, and the pain we met.
