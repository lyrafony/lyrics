[Verse]
The weight of the world falls on my chest,
A thousand thoughts, I can’t rest.
The air is thick, it’s hard to breathe,
But I can’t seem to let it leave.

[Chorus]
Beneath the weight, I feel so small,
A fragile soul, about to fall.
But in the dark, I still hold tight,
A spark of hope, a flicker of light.

[Verse]
The burdens rise, they never end,
But somewhere deep, I can transcend.
I close my eyes and feel the pain,
But I know the sun will rise again.

[Chorus]
Beneath the weight, I feel so small,
A fragile soul, about to fall.
But in the dark, I still hold tight,
A spark of hope, a flicker of light.

[Bridge]
And though the pressure pulls me low,
I’ll find a way, I’ll let it go.
The weight may crush, but I’ll survive,
In this battle, I’m still alive.

[Chorus]
Beneath the weight, I feel so small,
A fragile soul, about to fall.
But in the dark, I still hold tight,
A spark of hope, a flicker of light.

[Outro]
And when it’s over, I’ll stand tall,
Beneath the weight, I’ll rise above it all.
