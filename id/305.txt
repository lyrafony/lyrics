Title: Where the Wind Touches

[Verse 1]
Where the wind touches the trees,
That’s where your love whispers to me.
Soft as the light through morning dew,
I feel the world when I touch you.

[Verse 2]
The river knows the way we flow,
Gently moving, soft and slow.
No need for words, no need to try,
We bloom like clouds across the sky.

[Chorus]
In every leaf, I hear your name,
In every star, I see the flame.
Your soul and mine, just drifting free—
A part of earth, a part of sea.

[Bridge]
You and I, just breath and rain,
Love like roots that feel no chain.
In nature’s arms, we find our peace,
A love that flows and will not cease.

[Outro]
So close your eyes and float with me,
Beneath the moon, beside the sea.
Where nature sings, we make our vow—
No past, no end, just here and now.
