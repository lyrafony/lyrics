[Verse]
The anger rises like a tidal wave,
No longer quiet, no longer a slave.
The fire inside is burning bright,
Ready to fight, ready to ignite.

[Chorus]
Reign of rage, I’ll take control,
The fury inside has a heart and soul.
No more silence, no more fear,
The reign of rage is finally here.

[Verse]
You pushed me down, you thought I’d break,
But now I stand, no more mistakes.
I’ll tear down every wall you’ve built,
With the rage inside, I’ll make you wilt.

[Chorus]
Reign of rage, I’ll take control,
The fury inside has a heart and soul.
No more silence, no more fear,
The reign of rage is finally here.

[Bridge]
I’ll burn it all, I’ll make it burn,
With every flame, I will return.
The rage is my crown, I wear it high,
I’ll conquer the world, no asking why.

[Chorus]
Reign of rage, I’ll take control,
The fury inside has a heart and soul.
No more silence, no more fear,
The reign of rage is finally here.

[Outro]
The reign of rage will never end,
I’ll burn the world, and then ascend.
