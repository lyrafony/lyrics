[Verse 1]
I stumbled through the dark, no map to guide my way,
Every step I took felt like a mistake.
But even when I fall, I hear a quiet voice,
Whispering that breaking is just another choice.

[Pre-Chorus]
The ground may shake, but I’ll keep my stride,
Every scar I carry is a story of pride.
I’m not afraid to trip, to lose, to bend,
Because falling forward means I’m still moving ahead.

[Chorus]
Falling forward, I’ll rise from the pain,
Every stumble’s a lesson; every bruise has a name.
I won’t look back; I’ve burned all the chains,
Falling forward till I find open plains.

[Verse 2]
The weight of the world tried to pin me down,
But gravity can’t hold me when I wear my crown.
Each tear I cried became a river of fire,
Fueling my steps as I climb higher.

[Pre-Chorus]
The ground may shake, but I’ll keep my stride,
Every scar I carry is a story of pride.
I’m not afraid to trip, to lose, to bend,
Because falling forward means I’m still moving ahead.

[Chorus]
Falling forward, I’ll rise from the pain,
Every stumble’s a lesson; every bruise has a name.
I won’t look back; I’ve burned all the chains,
Falling forward till I find open plains.

[Bridge]
Oh, they said I’d never make it, said I’d break in two,
But I turned my fractures into something brand new.
This is my journey, my fight, my climb,
Falling forward keeps me running out of time.

[Final Section]
Falling forward, I’ll never stand still,
Even when the night feels colder than ever will.
With every fall, I learn to fly,
Falling forward till I touch the sky.
