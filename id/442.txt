[Verse 1]
I held it tight—my name, my pride
The stories I wore deep inside
But every step began to strain
Till letting go became the gain

[Verse 2]
I thought I’d need the world’s acclaim
The perfect script, the perfect name
But peace arrived with hands made bare
And freedom met me unaware

[Chorus]
Leave it behind, the weight, the crown
The voices pulling upward down
The narrow way won′t let it through
You lose the lie to find what′s true

[Verse 3]
Old dreams fell off like fading dust
The road ahead asked for my trust
And though the cost was sharp and clear
What stayed behind, I don’t miss here

[Chorus]
Leave it behind, the weight, the crown
The voices pulling upward down
The narrow way won′t let it through
You lose the lie to find what′s true

[Bridge]
Not every treasure’s meant to stay
Some shine, then quietly decay
But empty hands can now receive
A joy the world can′t steal or weave

[Final Chorus]
Leave it behind, the weight, the crown
The voices pulling upward down
I walk stripped down, and yet I find
I’ve never felt more light, more kind
