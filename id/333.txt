[Verse]
I’m falling deeper, lost in the void,
A place where silence is destroyed.
The shadows call, they whisper my name,
And I’m descending, no one to blame.

[Chorus]
Into the abyss, I’ll dive and fall,
Into the darkness, answering the call.
I’ll lose myself, but I’ll find my way,
Into the abyss, I’ll make my stay.

[Verse]
The weight of the world, it drags me down,
But I’ll wear my scars like a crown.
The abyss is vast, the end unknown,
But I’ll face the dark, I’ll walk alone.

[Chorus]
Into the abyss, I’ll dive and fall,
Into the darkness, answering the call.
I’ll lose myself, but I’ll find my way,
Into the abyss, I’ll make my stay.

[Bridge]
I’ll embrace the fear, I’ll welcome the pain,
Through the darkness, I’ll break the chains.
And in the depths, I’ll find my mind,
A new strength, a new light to find.

[Chorus]
Into the abyss, I’ll dive and fall,
Into the darkness, answering the call.
I’ll lose myself, but I’ll find my way,
Into the abyss, I’ll make my stay.

[Outro]
Into the abyss, I’ll rise again,
From the depths, I’ll begin again.
