[Intro]
You lift me up when I can’t find my way
Turn the shadows into golden days

[Verse 1]
I was trapped beneath the weight of my fears
But you showed me how to rise above the tears
With every word you say, with every hand you hold
You turn my broken pieces into something bold

[Pre-Chorus]
When I couldn’t see the light, you were my guide
You taught me how to leave the past behind
Now I’m climbing higher than I’ve ever been

[Chorus]
You take me to higher ground
Where the world feels lighter, where love is found
With you, I can touch the sky
No mountain’s too high, no storm can deny
You take me to higher ground
And with you, I’ll always be unbound

[Verse 2]
The doubts that once held me down are gone
You’re the reason I keep pushing on
Every step I take, I feel your strength in mine
Together we’re unstoppable, rewriting the lines

[Pre-Chorus]
When I couldn’t see the light, you were my guide
You taught me how to leave the past behind
Now I’m climbing higher than I’ve ever been

[Chorus]
You take me to higher ground
Where the world feels lighter, where love is found
With you, I can touch the sky
No mountain’s too high, no storm can deny
You take me to higher ground
And with you, I’ll always be unbound

[Bridge]
Even when the climb gets steep
You’re the one who makes me leap
With you, I’m stronger than I know
To new heights, we’ll always go

[Final Chorus]
You take me to higher ground
Where the world feels lighter, where love is found
With you, I can touch the sky
No mountain’s too high, no storm can deny
You take me to higher ground
And with you, I’ll always be unbound

[Outro]
Higher ground…
With you, I’ll always be found…
