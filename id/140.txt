[Intro]
You’re the silence in my mind
The calm I find when life’s unkind

[Verse 1]
I don’t need the world, I don’t need the stars
Just your heartbeat playing its part
In your embrace, I feel complete
Every moment with you is a gift, so sweet

[Pre-Chorus]
No matter where we are, no matter the time
Your love is the answer, it feels so right
It’s not about the things we own or the dreams we chase
It’s in your eyes, your smile, your grace

[Chorus]
You’re all that I need, you’re all that I want
With you, I’m whole, with you, I’m strong
No riches, no fame, no endless skies
Just you and me, that’s paradise
You’re all that I need, and I believe
That with you, I’ll always have everything

[Verse 2]
The simplest moments mean the most to me
Walking hand in hand, just you and me
No need for words, no need for show
Love like this is all I’ll ever know

[Pre-Chorus]
No matter where we are, no matter the time
Your love is the answer, it feels so right
It’s not about the things we own or the dreams we chase
It’s in your eyes, your smile, your grace

[Chorus]
You’re all that I need, you’re all that I want
With you, I’m whole, with you, I’m strong
No riches, no fame, no endless skies
Just you and me, that’s paradise
You’re all that I need, and I believe
That with you, I’ll always have everything

[Bridge]
If the world fades away, if the lights go out
I’ll still have your love, no room for doubt
You’re my shelter, my home, my truth
In your arms, I’ve found my proof

[Final Chorus]
You’re all that I need, you’re all that I want
With you, I’m whole, with you, I’m strong
No riches, no fame, no endless skies
Just you and me, that’s paradise
You’re all that I need, and I believe
That with you, I’ll always have everything
