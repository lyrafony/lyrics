[Verse 1]
I’ve been knocked down, I’ve been pushed away,
but I rise up stronger every day.
No more fear, no more chains,
I’ll break through, I’ll light the flames!

[Pre-Chorus]
Hear the thunder, feel the fight,
nothing’s gonna dim my light.
I won’t stop, I won’t fall,
I was born to take it all!

[Chorus]
I’ll never back down, never break,
I’m standing tall, won’t fade away!
Through the fire, through the pain,
I’ll keep fighting, I’ll remain!

[Verse 2]
I’ve heard the doubt, I’ve seen the lies,
but I’m still here, I’m still alive.
Every scar, a lesson learned,
every fall, a bridge I burned.

[Pre-Chorus]
Hear the thunder, feel the fight,
nothing’s gonna dim my light.
I won’t stop, I won’t fall,
I was born to take it all!

[Chorus]
I’ll never back down, never break,
I’m standing tall, won’t fade away!
Through the fire, through the pain,
I’ll keep fighting, I’ll remain!

[Bridge]
Let the storm rage, I won’t run,
I’ll keep fighting till I’ve won!
No retreat, no surrender,
I will rise, I will remember!

[Final Chorus]
I’ll never back down, never break,
I’m standing tall, won’t fade away!
Through the fire, through the pain,
I’ll keep fighting, I’ll remain!
