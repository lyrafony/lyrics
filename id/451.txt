[Verse 1]
The halls grew quiet, voices gone
Promises faded, one by one
I stood alone in empty space
A fading shadow, no embrace

[Verse 2]
Friends turned away, doors closed tight
Left me wandering through the night
But in the silence, something stayed
A presence no one else displayed

[Chorus]
When everyone left, I was still found
A steady heart without a sound
No crowds to cheer, no hands to hold
But a love that never grew cold
Though walls collapsed and trust was theft
I was not lost when everyone left

[Verse 3]
I cried my pain in empty rooms
Felt the weight of all the ruins
But through the cracks a light shone through
A faithful hand that pulled me through

[Chorus]
When everyone left, I was still found
A steady heart without a sound
No crowds to cheer, no hands to hold
But a love that never grew cold
Though walls collapsed and trust was theft
I was not lost when everyone left

[Bridge]
Not always seen, but always near
A constant voice when none would hear
In deepest night, when hope seemed gone
That love remained, forever strong

[Final Chorus]
When everyone left, I was still found
A steady heart without a sound
No crowds to cheer, no hands to hold
But a love that never grew cold
Though walls collapsed and trust was theft
I was not lost when everyone left
