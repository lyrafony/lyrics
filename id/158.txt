[Verse 1]
We stood there, with nothing to say,
The silence between us grew, then faded away.
I looked into your eyes, one last time,
And I knew that moment was our last climb.
The world kept turning, but I stayed still,
Caught in the ache, against my will.

[Chorus]
The last goodbye, I can’t let go,
But I know it’s time for me to let you go.
The last goodbye, it cuts so deep,
But now I see it’s time for me to sleep.
The last goodbye, it’s all we knew,
The final step to say we’re through.

[Verse 2]
I thought we’d make it, I thought we’d last,
But now I see, we were stuck in the past.
The tears I shed, they’ve all dried,
But the memories still linger inside.
I’ll carry the weight, but I’ll move on,
The chapter is closed, but the pain is strong.

[Chorus]
The last goodbye, I can’t let go,
But I know it’s time for me to let you go.
The last goodbye, it cuts so deep,
But now I see it’s time for me to sleep.
The last goodbye, it’s all we knew,
The final step to say we’re through.

[Bridge]
You were my everything, now you’re my past,
But the last goodbye is all we can ask.
The love we had, I’ll never forget,
But now it’s time to forgive and reset.

[Chorus]
The last goodbye, I can’t let go,
But I know it’s time for me to let you go.
The last goodbye, it cuts so deep,
But now I see it’s time for me to sleep.
The last goodbye, it’s all we knew,
The final step to say we’re through.

[Outro]
The last goodbye, and now I’ll fly,
With no more tears left to cry.
