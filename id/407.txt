[Verse 1]
Within the hush where shadows cease
A sacred realm of whispered peace
No voice disrupts, no sound intrudes
Just holy calm in quietudes

[Verse 2]
The spirit finds its secret place
A gentle hand, a warm embrace
Where time dissolves and fears release
The soul is clothed in boundless grace

[Chorus]
Sanctuary of silence, pure and deep
Where restless hearts may softly sleep
Beyond the noise, beyond the strife
A sacred stillness births new life

[Verse 3]
Beneath the veil of mortal sound
Eternal truths are gently found
A breath of grace, a holy fire
Kindling hope and pure desire

[Chorus]
Sanctuary of silence, pure and deep
Where restless hearts may softly sleep
Beyond the noise, beyond the strife
A sacred stillness births new life

[Bridge]
In quiet prayer and softened light
The soul is raised beyond the night
With sacred strength and gentle hand
It walks the path where angels stand

[Final Chorus]
Sanctuary of silence, pure and deep
Where restless hearts may softly sleep
Beyond the noise, beyond the strife
A sacred stillness births new life
