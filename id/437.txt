[Verse 1]
The path is rough, the ground is wild
No cushion here for heart or child
Each step I take cuts deep and slow
Yet something grows with every blow

[Verse 2]
The thorns, they bite, but don’t defeat
They bruise my pride beneath my feet
And every wound I try to hide
Becomes the mark of one who died

[Chorus]
Thorns underfoot, I walk in pain
But not in loss, and not in vain
The ache becomes a sacred sign
That what I seek is not yet mine

[Verse 3]
No comfort lines this broken trail
But still I walk, though limbs may fail
For every thorn beneath my tread
Breaks what must die so life’s ahead

[Chorus]
Thorns underfoot, I walk in pain
But not in loss, and not in vain
The ache becomes a sacred sign
That what I seek is not yet mine

[Bridge]
If joy were easy, shallow, near
I’d miss the truth that costs me dear
So let the thorns remind me still
This path was carved through greater will

[Final Chorus]
Thorns underfoot, I walk in pain
Each step engraved with what I’ve gained
Not wealth or ease, but something true—
A heart made whole by walking through
