[Verse 1]
Voices linger in the hollowed halls,
repeating doubts, replaying falls.
They whisper truths, they twist the lies,
a fractured choir in my mind’s skies.

[Pre-Chorus]
I try to silence, but they remain,
an endless loop of joy and pain.

[Chorus]
In the echo chamber of my soul,
every thought takes its toll.
I hear their calls, both faint and loud,
but I’m learning to rise above the crowd.

[Verse 2]
The echoes clash, they pull and strain,
sometimes soothing, sometimes insane.
But through the noise, a rhythm grows,
a quiet pulse that softly glows.

[Bridge]
They’re not my chains, they’re just my guide,
reminders I’m still alive inside.
Even in chaos, there’s harmony,
a song of self-discovery.

[Final Section]
In the echo chamber of my soul,
every thought takes its toll.
I hear their calls, both faint and loud,
but I’m learning to rise above the crowd.
