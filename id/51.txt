Verse 1
I was tired of the games, tired of lies,
You said you’d call, but you never tried.
No romance, just wasted time,
I needed someone who’d treat me fine.

So I went online, found a store,
A boyfriend who’s programmed to adore.
No more pain, no more wait,
My robot’s here—he’s my perfect mate.

Pre-Chorus
He doesn’t ghost, he doesn’t stray,
He’s always there at the end of the day.
No drama, no fights, just smooth code,
Why didn’t I do this before?

Chorus
I replaced you with a robot,
Yeah, I found love in a machine.
He’s got no ego, he’s always on time,
And he charges overnight—what a dream!
I replaced you with a robot,
Now my heart’s finally free.
You were too much like a human,
But my robot’s perfect for me.

Verse 2
He remembers dates, brings me flowers,
Never forgets anniversaries or hours.
His voice is smooth, his touch is light,
He’s everything you weren’t—just right.

No trust falls, no therapy talks,
He doesn’t judge me or check his clocks.
I set the rules, I make the plan,
Who needs a man when you’ve got this hand?

Chorus
I replaced you with a robot,
Yeah, I found love in a machine.
He’s got no ego, he’s always on time,
And he charges overnight—what a dream!
I replaced you with a robot,
Now my heart’s finally free.
You were too much like a human,
But my robot’s perfect for me.
