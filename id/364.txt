[Verse]
Lost in fields of shattered light,
Whispers haunt the edge of night.
Every breath a fleeting sound,
Every dream half underground.

[Pre-Chorus]
I reach for things that slip through stone,
Building towers with cloudbone.

[Chorus]
Cloudbones drift across my mind,
Broken shapes I’ll never find.
Hollow frames in silver skies,
Fading slow before my eyes.

[Verse]
Steps dissolve beneath my feet,
Memories taste sharp and sweet.
Threading needles through the rain,
Sewing hope with strands of pain.

[Pre-Chorus]
I reach for things that slip through stone,
Building towers with cloudbone.

[Chorus]
Cloudbones drift across my mind,
Broken shapes I’ll never find.
Hollow frames in silver skies,
Fading slow before my eyes.

[Bridge]
Weightless wings that never fly,
Glass reflections in my sky.
Chasing phantoms made of mist,
Another wish I won’t resist.

[Chorus]
Cloudbones drift across my mind,
Broken shapes I’ll never find.
Hollow frames in silver skies,
Fading slow before my eyes.

[Outro]
Cloudbones fall,
I fall too,
Into dreams I can′t undo.
