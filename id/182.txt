[Verse 1]
Steel and circuits in my veins,
Born to fight, I feel no pain.
Every move, a perfect strike,
Programmed edge, ready to bite.

No regrets, no second tries,
Metal heart, electric eyes.
This machine will never fall,
Built to win, I take it all.

[Chorus]
Wired for war, I never break,
Power surging, wide awake.
Through the fire, through the storm,
I was made to take it all.

[Verse 2]
Flashing warnings in my mind,
System locked, no time to hide.
Through the wreckage, through the dust,
I don’t bleed, I only crush.

No commands, no master’s chains,
I decide, I make my way.
Upgrade fear, erase the doubt,
Turn me on, I’m burning out.

[Chorus]
Wired for war, I never break,
Power surging, wide awake.
Through the fire, through the storm,
I was made to take it all.

[Bridge]
Push the limit, feel the spark,
One last hit to stop my heart.
If I fall, I’ll rise again,
Reignite and start again.

[Chorus]
Wired for war, I never break,
Power surging, wide awake.
Through the fire, through the storm,
I was made to take it all.
