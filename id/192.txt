[Intro]
Shadows fall, cold winds blow,
Whispers of the past that I’ll never know,
Trust was given, betrayed in time,
Now you′re just a ghost I’ll leave behind.

[Verso 1]
You said you’d be there when the storm raged on,
But you vanished when I needed you strong.
Like a coward, you ran, left me to fight,
Now I see you for what you are — a lie.

[Pre-Coro]
I’ve been broken, I’ve been torn,
But I’ll rise again, I won’t mourn.
The darkness inside is my only friend,
And I′ll carry this hatred to the very end.

[Coro]
Betrayed in the dark, left to rot in the cold,
You tore me apart, and now the story’s told.
I trusted you once, but now I see the scar,
You’re nothing but a shadow, fading from afar.

[Verso 2]
I gave you everything, but you took it all,
Left me bleeding on the ground, waiting for the fall.
The memories, they haunt me like chains of regret,
But I’ll never forget, no, I’ll never forget.

[Puente]
You thought you’d bury me in your lies,
But now I’m rising, no more disguise.
I’ll haunt your every step, your every dream,
You’ll never forget the way I scream.

[Coro]
Betrayed in the dark, left to rot in the cold,
You tore me apart, and now the story’s told.
I trusted you once, but now I see the scar,
You’re nothing but a shadow, fading from afar.

[Outro]
Shattered trust, no turning back,
I’ll find my peace in the darkness I lack.
You won’t remember the man you killed,
But I′ll see you in the shadows, where your soul′s been sealed.
