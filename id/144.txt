[Intro]
Night falls, but the war don’t stop…

[Verse 1]
Another name on the wall, another mother cryin’,
City full of dreams, but most of ‘em dyin’.
Street code written in the cracks of the pavement,
Tryna find peace but I’m trapped in enslavement.

Raised by the struggle, baptized in the flames,
Taught to keep movin’, never speak names.
Loyalty’s a gamble, bettin’ with your soul,
One wrong call, now you deep in a hole.

[Pre-Chorus]
Dark skies, cold hands, blood on the streets,
Echoes of the block still callin’ to me.
Tryna break free, but the chains hold tight,
Ain’t no mercy in the dead of the night.

[Chorus]
Ghosts walk where the sirens scream,
Lost souls caught in the dream.
Lookin’ for a way but the roads don’t change,
Another story lost in the city of pain.

[Verse 2]
Ran with the wolves, never looked back,
Life played dirty, had to learn how to adapt.
Every man for himself when the chips fall,
They love you in the moment, then they ghost when you crawl.

City lights flash, but they never guide,
Just another trap tryna pull you inside.
Seen kings turn pawns in the blink of an eye,
Another day, another name in the sky.

[Pre-Chorus]
Dark skies, cold hands, blood on the streets,
Echoes of the block still callin’ to me.
Tryna break free, but the chains hold tight,
Ain’t no mercy in the dead of the night.

[Chorus]
Ghosts walk where the sirens scream,
Lost souls caught in the dream.
Lookin’ for a way but the roads don’t change,
Another story lost in the city of pain.

[Bridge]
No hope, no light, just the sound of regret,
Footsteps fade, but they never forget.

[Verse 3]
Maybe we were born where the sun don’t shine,
Maybe fate carved out the end in time.
Maybe some voices were meant to fade,
Another echo in the block, lost in the shade.

[Outro]
Night falls, but the war don’t stop…
