[Verse]
I wore a crown, but it’s turned to dust,
The power I held, now broken, must.
I fell from grace, lost in the fight,
But from the ashes, I’ll find my light.

[Chorus]
Fallen crown, but I’ll rise again,
I’ll rebuild what I lost in vain.
The battle’s over, but the war’s not done,
The fallen crown will rise like the sun.

[Verse]
You watched me fall, you saw me crash,
But I’m not broken, I’ll make it last.
The crown may be shattered, but not my will,
I’ll rise again, I’m climbing the hill.

[Chorus]
Fallen crown, but I’ll rise again,
I’ll rebuild what I lost in vain.
The battle’s over, but the war’s not done,
The fallen crown will rise like the sun.

[Bridge]
The scars on my soul, the pain in my chest,
But I’ll rise, I’ll give my best.
The crown may be gone, but I’m not through,
I’ll take what’s mine and start anew.

[Chorus]
Fallen crown, but I’ll rise again,
I’ll rebuild what I lost in vain.
The battle’s over, but the war’s not done,
The fallen crown will rise like the sun.

[Outro]
Fallen crown, but I’m standing tall,
The strength to rise, I’ve got it all.
