[Verse 1]
Neon lights flicker, but they never dim,
Static in my mind, it’s deafening.
Scrolling through the void, a hollow glow,
Searching for a signal, but I don’t know.

[Pre-Chorus]
Every ping, every flash, another wave of noise,
I’m drowning in the echoes of synthetic joys.
But somewhere in the silence, there’s a voice I need to find,
Beneath the neon static, there’s a calm I left behind.

[Chorus]
Neon static, it’s pulling me under,
Bright distractions masking the thunder.
I’ll break through the haze, I’ll cut through the sound,
Find the quiet I lost when the world spun around.

[Verse 2]
Headphones on tight, but the noise won’t fade,
A digital maze where my thoughts cascade.
The city hums louder, a symphony of pain,
But I’ll rewrite the rhythm, rearrange the strain.

[Pre-Chorus]
Every ping, every flash, another wave of noise,
I’m drowning in the echoes of synthetic joys.
But somewhere in the silence, there’s a voice I need to find,
Beneath the neon static, there’s a calm I left behind.

[Chorus]
Neon static, it’s pulling me under,
Bright distractions masking the thunder.
I’ll break through the haze, I’ll cut through the sound,
Find the quiet I lost when the world spun around.

[Bridge]
Oh, the noise keeps rising, it’s taking control,
But I’ll unplug the wires, reclaim my soul.
This static isn’t forever; it’s just a fleeting frame,
I’ll rise from the chaos and call out my name.

[Final Section]
Neon static fades, the hum grows still,
I’ve found the silence beneath the thrill.
The world keeps spinning, but I’m standing apart,
Neon static can’t touch this quiet heart.
