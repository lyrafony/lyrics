[Intro]
Every step I take, I hear your name
In the silence, it’s always the same

[Verse 1]
The echoes of us still linger near
Whispering softly in my ear
I see your shadow in every room
Even when the lights are dim, you illuminate the gloom

[Pre-Chorus]
No matter how much I try to move on
Your memory stays, a constant song
It’s like you’re everywhere I go
A ghost of love that won’t let go

[Chorus]
Echoes of us, they follow me still
Through every heartbeat, every chill
I can’t erase what we used to be
You’re carved into my melody
Echoes of us, they never fade
In every moment, in every shade

[Verse 2]
The laughter we shared, the tears we cried
Are etched into the fabric of time
Even though we’ve gone our separate ways
Your presence lingers through all my days

[Pre-Chorus]
No matter how much I try to move on
Your memory stays, a constant song
It’s like you’re everywhere I go
A ghost of love that won’t let go

[Chorus]
Echoes of us, they follow me still
Through every heartbeat, every chill
I can’t erase what we used to be
You’re carved into my melody
Echoes of us, they never fade
In every moment, in every shade

[Bridge]
If I could rewrite the story of us
Would it end the same, or would it trust?
But even in silence, you’re alive
In every echo, you survive

[Final Chorus]
Echoes of us, they follow me still
Through every heartbeat, every chill
I can’t erase what we used to be
You’re carved into my melody
Echoes of us, they never fade
In every moment, in every shade

[Outro]
Echoes of us…
They never fade…
Still here, still you…
