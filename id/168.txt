[Intro]
Yeah, you know how we do,
We rise again… no matter what.

[Verse 1]
Woke up to the sound of the city beat,
Every step I take, feel the heat in the street.
They told me I was finished, said I’d never last,
But look at me now, I′m breakin′ the past.

Chasin’ every dream that they said was too far,
Now I’m ridin’ high like a shining star.
I got my mind right, got my game tight,
Watch me rise, baby, we’re takin’ flight.

[Pre-Chorus]
They can’t stop me now, no, I’m on a roll,
Watch me take the crown, I’m in control.
Every setback, just a step ahead,
I’ll keep risin′ ′til I’m outta my head.

[Chorus]
Ohhh, we gon’ rise again,
Turn the pain into a win.
Ohhh, no more fallin′ down,
We gon′ rise up, take the crown.

[Verse 2]
They tried to block my shine, but the sun stays bright,
Kept my focus sharp, now I’m takin′ flight.
Put the hustle in my heart, fire in my soul,
Now I’m livin’ proof you can still take control.

The world’s been heavy, but I won’t let it weigh,
I’m chasin’ my dreams, never backin’ away.
Got my eyes on the prize, ain’t no lookin’ back,
Watch me rise, watch me stay on track.

[Pre-Chorus]
They can’t stop me now, no, I’m on a roll,
Watch me take the crown, I’m in control.
Every setback, just a step ahead,
I’ll keep risin′ ′til I’m outta my head.

[Chorus]
Ohhh, we gon’ rise again,
Turn the pain into a win.
Ohhh, no more fallin′ down,
We gon′ rise up, take the crown.

[Bridge]
They can try to break us, but we’ll stand tall,
We gon’ rise again, we’ll never fall.

[Verse 3]
Look at me now, got the world in my hand,
I’m the one they doubted, now I take a stand.
Every struggle was a lesson, every scar was a fight,
Now I’m risin’ up, I’m takin’ flight.

[Outro]
We gon’ rise… again…
Yeah, we gon’ rise… again…
