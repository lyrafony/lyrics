[Verse 1]
When shadows fall and help is sought
The hands once raised remain distraught
Eyes that glance but do not see
Promises lost in apathy

[Verse 2]
Voices loud in public praise
Yet silent when the spirit prays
A hollow faith, a shallow stand
No comfort given, just demand

[Chorus]
Empty hands, no strength to hold
When storms arise, no hand to fold
They ask for more, but give so less
In empty hands, we find distress

[Verse 3]
Alone we walk through trials bare
While silence fills the vacant air
The ones who shout for aid and grace
Disappear without a trace

[Chorus]
Empty hands, no strength to hold
When storms arise, no hand to fold
They ask for more, but give so less
In empty hands, we find distress

[Bridge]
True help is born from heartâ€™s embrace
Not words that vanish without trace
Reach beyond the selfish cries
Where genuine mercy never dies

[Final Chorus]
Empty hands, no strength to hold
When storms arise, no hand to fold
They ask for more, but give so less
In empty hands, we find distress
