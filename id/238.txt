[Verse]
Beneath the veil where silence reigns,
A pulse of fire runs through my veins.
The shadows dance, they pull me near,
Whispering truths I long to hear.

[Chorus]
Through the dark, we’ll find our way,
In the rhythm, we’ll never stray.
Feel the beat, let it consume,
Dancing in the shadow’s bloom.

[Verse]
The night is heavy, but I’m awake,
Every heartbeat a choice I make.
No light to guide, no fear to stay,
This is where the lost ones play.

[Bridge]
Ohhh… ohhh…
Falling deeper into the haze…
Ohhh… ohhh…
Lost within the endless blaze…

[Outro]
We rise, we fall, we break the chain,
Forever chasing through the pain.
In every shadow, in every sound,
We’ll keep on moving, never found.
