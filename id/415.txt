[Verse 1]
A quiet void beneath the skin
Where questions live and doubts begin
No thunder speaks, no lightning strikes
Just empty halls and fading lights

[Verse 2]
I walk alone in shadows deep
Where faith and fear refuse to sleep
The silent abyss calls my name
A whispered voice without a flame

[Chorus]
In the silent abyss, I stand
Reaching out with trembling hand
Though darkness tries to pull me down
I search for light beneath the sound

[Verse 3]
No clear answers come to me
Just hidden signs I strain to see
The space between belief and loss
Where hope is fragile, never lost

[Chorus]
In the silent abyss, I stand
Reaching out with trembling hand
Though darkness tries to pull me down
I search for light beneath the sound

[Bridge]
If faith is found in broken cries
Then here I am, beneath these skies
Still holding on, though shadows sway
Waiting for dawnâ€™s gentle day

[Final Chorus]
In the silent abyss, I stand
Reaching out with trembling hand
Though darkness tries to pull me down
I search for light beneath the sound
