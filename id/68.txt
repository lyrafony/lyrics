[Verse 1]
The walls are bare, but they’re heavy with sound,
Echoes of memories spinning around.
Every step I take feels like stepping in time,
Reliving the moments I thought I’d left behind.

[Pre-Chorus]
The silence is screaming, it’s filling my head,
A thousand conversations with things left unsaid.
But maybe this quiet is where I belong,
Where the echoes of emptiness help me grow strong.

[Chorus]
Empty room echoes, they call out my name,
Whispers of heartbreak, whispers of pain.
But in this stillness, I’m learning to hear,
The voice that was buried beneath all the fear.

[Verse 2]
I trace the cracks where the light used to fall,
Shadows of laughter now cover the walls.
It’s not the emptiness that breaks me apart,
It’s the pieces of me scattered across the dark.

[Pre-Chorus]
The silence is screaming, it’s filling my head,
A thousand conversations with things left unsaid.
But maybe this quiet is where I belong,
Where the echoes of emptiness help me grow strong.

[Chorus]
Empty room echoes, they call out my name,
Whispers of heartbreak, whispers of pain.
But in this stillness, I’m learning to hear,
The voice that was buried beneath all the fear.

[Bridge]
Oh, the echoes fade slower than I thought they would,
But I’m piecing together the fragments I could.
This room isn’t empty; it’s holding my fight,
Turning the shadows into streams of light.

[Final Section]
Empty room echoes, they’ve shown me the way,
Through the noise and the silence, I’ve found what to say.
The echoes don’t haunt me; they’ve set me free,
In this empty room, I’ve reclaimed me.
