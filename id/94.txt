[Verse 1]
I’ve been wandering through empty days,
Chasing shadows, losing ways.
The fire that once burned bright and wild,
Got buried under life’s piled-up trials.
But lately, I feel a flicker near,
A spark that whispers, “Come back here.”
The colors fade, but they’re not gone,
They’re waiting for me to turn them on.

[Pre-Chorus]
It’s hard to find what you’ve left behind,
When the world keeps shifting, keeps redefining.
But deep inside, the embers glow,
Calling me back to who I know.

[Chorus]
I’ll reignite the flame I lost,
No matter what it may have cost.
The dreams I shelved, the songs unsung,
They’re begging now to be begun.
With every step, I’ll feel alive,
Reclaiming pieces of my drive.
This is my time, my second chance,
To dance with passion’s fiery stance.

[Verse 2]
I remember nights when stars would guide,
When creativity flowed like tides.
But somewhere along the winding road,
I traded sparks for heavier loads.
Now echoes call from distant shores,
Reminders of the love I swore.
The canvas waits, the pen stands still,
It’s time to bend to my own will.

[Pre-Chorus]
It’s hard to find what you’ve left behind,
When the world keeps shifting, keeps redefining.
But deep inside, the embers glow,
Calling me back to who I know.

[Chorus]
I’ll reignite the flame I lost,
No matter what it may have cost.
The dreams I shelved, the songs unsung,
They’re begging now to be begun.
With every step, I’ll feel alive,
Reclaiming pieces of my drive.
This is my time, my second chance,
To dance with passion’s fiery stance.

[Bridge]
Maybe forgetting was part of the plan,
To teach me how to truly understand.
The fire doesn’t die—it just hides away,
Until we’re ready to let it stay.
So I’ll fan the flames, let them grow wide,
And watch as passion takes me for the ride.

[Outro]
Reignite the flame, let it burn bright,
Feel the warmth of rediscovered light.
No more silence, no more delay,
My heart is home, it knows the way.
Reignite the flame… and let me see,
The beauty of who I’m meant to be.
