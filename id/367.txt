[Verse 1]
Waves that rise and stars that shine
All move within a grand design
An unseen thread that binds the whole
The silent force that holds the soul

[Verse 2]
Mountains stand and rivers flow
By power no one seems to know
Yet every breath and every wing
Exists because of this unseen thing

[Chorus]
Through Him, all things are made and kept
The quiet hand where life has slept
No crown to wear, no throne to claim
Yet nothing moves apart from His name

[Verse 3]
The pulse beneath the beating heart
The sacred rhythm, every part
Unbroken chain, eternal ring
The song that makes the cosmos sing

[Chorus]
Through Him, all things are made and kept
The quiet hand where life has slept
No crown to wear, no throne to claim
Yet nothing moves apart from His name

[Bridge]
Beyond the eye, beyond the sight
The source of day, the birth of light
A mystery we cannot see
But one that flows inside of me

[Final Chorus]
Through Him, all things are made and kept
The quiet hand where life has slept
No crown to wear, no throne to claim
Yet nothing moves apart from His name
