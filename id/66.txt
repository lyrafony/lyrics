[Verse 1]
I close my eyes and let the colors bleed,
A world of wonder where I’m free to breathe.
The weight of the ground feels too hard to bear,
So I run to the dreams waiting somewhere out there.

[Pre-Chorus]
They call it a fantasy, say it’s not real,
But I feel it alive in the way I heal.
Every star in the sky is a map to the start,
Runaway dreams are the pulse of my heart.

[Chorus]
Runaway dreams, they carry me high,
Through the clouds and the storms in the sky.
When the world gets too heavy, I’ll take to the air,
Runaway dreams are the ones that repair.

[Verse 2]
I’ve built a home in the spaces unseen,
Where the broken can dance and the lost can dream.
The echoes of doubt can’t follow me here,
This is my haven, my refuge so clear.

[Pre-Chorus]
They call it a fantasy, say it’s not real,
But I feel it alive in the way I heal.
Every star in the sky is a map to the start,
Runaway dreams are the pulse of my heart.

[Chorus]
Runaway dreams, they carry me high,
Through the clouds and the storms in the sky.
When the world gets too heavy, I’ll take to the air,
Runaway dreams are the ones that repair.

[Bridge]
Oh, they try to pull me back, tie me down,
But I’ll chase the horizon where the skies have no bounds.
These dreams aren’t just shadows; they’re fire in my veins,
I’ll turn every vision into something I claim.

[Final Section]
Runaway dreams, they’ve led me this far,
To a place where the future feels unscarred.
The lines between dreaming and living collide,
Runaway dreams are now my life inside.
