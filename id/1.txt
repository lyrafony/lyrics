[Verse 1]
Wake up, the sun is shining bright,
Don't think about tomorrow, just feel the light,
Take a breath, let go of the fight,
Live today, everything feels so right.

[Chorus]
Enjoy the moment, feel the vibe,
Dance through life, no need to hide,
Every second is a chance to ride,
Let go and enjoy the moment, side by side.

[Verse 2]
The world keeps turning, but we stand still,
Laughing, living, with time to kill,
No worries on our minds, just a thrill,
Enjoy the moment, just feel the chill.

[Chorus]
Enjoy the moment, feel the vibe,
Dance through life, no need to hide,
Every second is a chance to ride,
Let go and enjoy the moment, side by side.

[Bridge]
We don’t need no plan, we’re living free,
The future can wait, we just wanna be,
In the now, with you and me,
Enjoy the moment, endlessly.

[Chorus]
Enjoy the moment, feel the vibe,
Dance through life, no need to hide,
Every second is a chance to ride,
Let go and enjoy the moment, side by side.

[Outro]
Enjoy the moment, feel it all,
No time to waste, let's have a ball,
Enjoy the moment, no matter how small,
Just keep on living, together we’ll stand tall.
