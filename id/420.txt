[Verse 1]
A fragile thread, so thin and fine
Connects my heart to the divine
Though winds may tear and storms may shred
I cling to hope’s faintest thread

[Verse 2]
In moments lost and nights of fear
That slender line remains so clear
It pulls me through the darkest dread
That fragile thread I dare to tread

[Chorus]
Faintest thread, don’t let me go
Hold me tight when doubts will grow
Though shadows fall and faith feels thin
I trust the thread that pulls within

[Verse 3]
It’s not the strength I thought I knew
But something quiet, pure, and true
A silent vow, a whispered pledge
That guides me past each breaking edge

[Chorus]
Faintest thread, don’t let me go
Hold me tight when doubts will grow
Though shadows fall and faith feels thin
I trust the thread that pulls within

[Bridge]
When all is lost and paths are blind
That thread remains to help me find
The way back home, the way to light
The fragile link that fuels my fight

[Final Chorus]
Faintest thread, don’t let me go
Hold me tight when doubts will grow
Though shadows fall and faith feels thin
I trust the thread that pulls within
