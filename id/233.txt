[Verse]
The tide is rising, pulling me in,
A current of dreams beneath my skin.
I feel the weight of all I’ve known,
But the waves are calling me home.

[Chorus]
Higher than the stars, deeper than the sea,
Every heartbeat carries the key.
Through the chaos, through the sound,
In the silence, I am found.

[Verse]
The horizon glows, a fading line,
Between the now and what’s divine.
Each step I take, a fleeting trace,
Of who I was, of who I’ll face.

[Bridge]
Ohhh… ohhh…
Breaking through the veil of time…
Ohhh… ohhh…
Riding waves of light sublime…

[Outro]
We rise, we fall, we learn to flow,
Through every shadow, through every glow.
In the tides, we find our way,
Forever searching, come what may.
