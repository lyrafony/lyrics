[Verse]
Neon lights, a city so bright,
Yet every face is drained of light.
Stories to tell, but no one cares,
Lost in silence, blank cold stares.

[Verse]
Eyes avoid, no words exchanged,
Each one lost inside their maze.
Footsteps echo down empty streets,
Routine rules, and dreams retreat.

[Pre-Chorus]
Racing fast to meet the pay,
No time to live, just waste away.

[Chorus]
We grind and sweat to just get by,
We've called this life, but it's a lie.
Chasing numbers, chasing air,
This is the life we all must bear.

[Verse]
Try to break out, leave it behind,
But the weight drags down your mind.
Step too far, you lose control,
The fear will swallow you whole.

[Verse]
Better stay and play the game,
Survive the day, embrace the chain.
Close your eyes, just march ahead,
One day closer to the end.

[Pre-Chorus]
Racing fast to meet the pay,
No time to live, just waste away.

[Chorus]
We grind and sweat to just get by,
We've called this life, but it's a lie.
Chasing numbers, chasing air,
This is the life we all must bear.
