Title: In the Bamboo Wind

[Verse 1]
Bamboo sways in gentle breeze,
Bending soft with quiet ease.
No need to fight the shifting air,
In letting go, we find our care.

[Verse 2]
Leaves will fall and seasons change,
Paths will shift, and hearts rearrange.
Stillness grows in what we release,
A silent song of inner peace.

[Chorus]
In the bamboo wind, I learn to bend,
To find the strength in what I send.
No fear in change, no need to bind,
Peace is the calm I seek to find.

[Bridge]
When storms arise and skies grow dim,
The bamboo stands, though winds grow grim.
With every sway, a lesson true,
To rise again, to start anew.

[Outro]
Bamboo bends but never breaks,
In the wind, my spirit wakes.
