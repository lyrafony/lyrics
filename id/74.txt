[Verse 1]
They threw their stones, but I didn’t break,
Every crack they made just built my strength.
I’m not a mirror; I won’t reflect their hate,
I’m shatterproof now; I’ve earned my defense.

[Pre-Chorus]
The cracks in my armor are battle scars,
Proof that I’ve fought through the harshest wars.
They tried to destroy me, but I’m still here,
Shatterproof heart with nothing to fear.

[Chorus]
Shatterproof, I’ll never come undone,
Built from the ashes of everything I’ve won.
They can throw their daggers, but I’ll never fall,
Shatterproof walls protect it all.

[Verse 2]
The storms kept raging, but I stood my ground,
Every thunderclap was just a familiar sound.
I’ve learned to dance in the rain of their disdain,
Now their words feel like whispers; they’re powerless again.

[Pre-Chorus]
The cracks in my armor are battle scars,
Proof that I’ve fought through the harshest wars.
They tried to destroy me, but I’m still here,
Shatterproof heart with nothing to fear.

[Chorus]
Shatterproof, I’ll never come undone,
Built from the ashes of everything I’ve won.
They can throw their daggers, but I’ll never fall,
Shatterproof walls protect it all.

[Bridge]
Oh, they thought they’d break me, leave me in despair,
But I turned their weapons into something rare.
This shatterproof soul is unbreakable steel,
And I’ll wield it like fire; I’ll never reveal.

[Final Section]
Shatterproof, I’ll always remain,
Through the chaos and pain, I’ll never wane.
Their games can’t touch me; their hate’s obsolete,
Shatterproof heart, forever complete.
