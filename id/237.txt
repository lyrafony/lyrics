[Verse]
I hear the echoes calling loud,
A rhythm born from shadows proud.
Each step I take, a fleeting trace,
Of dreams that time cannot erase.

[Chorus]
We’re dancing through the echoes now,
Where yesterday meets here and how.
In every beat, in every sound,
The future’s waiting to be found.

[Verse]
The night is deep, but I’m alive,
With every pulse, I start to thrive.
No fear remains, no chains to bind,
The music lifts me out of mind.

[Bridge]
Ohhh… ohhh…
Through the dark, we’ll find our way…
Ohhh… ohhh…
Turning night into day…

[Outro]
We move as one, we feel the fire,
Chasing dreams that take us higher.
In every moment, we belong,
Forever searching, forever strong.
