Title: Your Silence Is a Song

[Verse 1]
No need for words, no need for sound,
Your silence wraps the world around.
A stillness deeper than the sea,
Yet every breath sings back to me.

[Verse 2]
You say so much with quiet eyes,
A truth that language can’t disguise.
I listen close, and there it plays —
A melody of gentle ways.

[Chorus]
Your silence is a song I know,
A quiet tune that makes me grow.
Not every love needs lines or rhyme,
Some songs are sung beyond all time.

[Bridge]
Between the spaces, soft and wide,
Your spirit sings and walks beside.
No echo loud, no need for more,
Just silence humming at the core.

[Outro]
Your silence is a song, so true,
And every pause brings me to you.
