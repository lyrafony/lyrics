[Verse 1]
I saw your smile from across the sea,
A spark of light in a world of gray for me.
No matter the distance, no matter the place,
Your heart found mine in this endless race.

[Pre-Chorus]
We speak different tongues, but our souls collide,
Underneath the same moon, we’re side by side.

[Chorus]
Love without borders, no walls can hold,
Our hearts are one, a story untold.
Through every mountain, through every shore,
With you, my love, I’m forever sure.
Love without borders, it’s you and me,
Together we’ll fly, wild and free.

[Verse 2]
The rhythm of life pulls us together,
Every step we take, the world feels lighter.
From sunrise to sunset, we cross the line,
Your love is the melody, I’m singing in time.

[Pre-Chorus]
We’ve broken the chains, we’ve crossed the divide,
In your arms, I’ve found where I belong inside.

[Chorus]
Love without borders, no walls can hold,
Our hearts are one, a story untold.
Through every mountain, through every shore,
With you, my love, I’m forever sure.
Love without borders, it’s you and me,
Together we’ll fly, wild and free.

[Bridge]
Oh, the oceans may rise, the skies may fall,
But nothing can break what we’ve built at all.
No map can show the path we’ve made,
Our love is the journey, never afraid.

[Chorus]
Love without borders, no walls can hold,
Our hearts are one, a story untold.
Through every mountain, through every shore,
With you, my love, I’m forever sure.
Love without borders, it’s you and me,
Together we’ll fly, wild and free.

[Outro]
Love without borders, it’s you and me,
Forever we’ll dance in eternity.
