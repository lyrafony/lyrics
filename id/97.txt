Title: Fighting the existential void

[Verse 1]
I’ve been staring at the ceiling,
Searching for some greater meaning.
Days blur into endless nights,
A hollow ache, a restless fight.
The questions pile, they overwhelm,
Why am I here? What is the helm?
Yet somewhere deep, a whisper calls,
“Find purpose in the smallest falls.”

[Pre-Chorus]
It’s hard to feel when nothing seems real,
When life feels like spinning wheels.
But even voids can hold a spark,
A chance to light up all the dark.

[Chorus]
I’ll fight this void, though it consumes,
Through empty rooms and silent tunes.
Every moment holds a seed,
Even chaos plants the need.
With every step, I’ll carve my way,
Turn the gray into gold each day.
This emptiness won’t claim my soul,
I’ll fill the gaps, make myself whole.

[Verse 2]
The weight of being presses down,
An endless cycle, no renown.
What’s the point of all this pain?
Will tomorrow bring relief or strain?
But then I see the fleeting glow,
In simple acts, in letting go.
Perhaps the “why” isn’t the key,
But living just to simply be.

[Pre-Chorus]
It’s hard to feel when nothing seems real,
When life feels like spinning wheels.
But even voids can hold a spark,
A chance to light up all the dark.

[Chorus]
I’ll fight this void, though it consumes,
Through empty rooms and silent tunes.
Every moment holds a seed,
Even chaos plants the need.
With every step, I’ll carve my way,
Turn the gray into gold each day.
This emptiness won’t claim my soul,
I’ll fill the gaps, make myself whole.
