--

[Verse 1]
Once they ruled with iron hands
Building towers on shifting sands
Golden thrones now cracked and torn
Silent signs of kingdoms worn

[Verse 2]
Promises broken, trust betrayed
Empires crumble, debts are paid
The weight of greed, a heavy cost
The mighty fall, the proud are lost

[Chorus]
Broken crowns, they fall to dust
Fallen pride, forgotten lust
No power lasts beyond the night
Justice comes to claim the right

[Verse 3]
From shattered halls and broken chains
A whispered hope forever remains
Though darkness tries to hold its sway
The dawn will break, the night will sway

[Chorus]
Broken crowns, they fall to dust
Fallen pride, forgotten lust
No power lasts beyond the night
Justice comes to claim the right

[Bridge]
No throne can stand against the truth
No empire lasts beyond its youth
The end is near, the scales will weigh
And light will chase the dark away

[Final Chorus]
Broken crowns, they fall to dust
Fallen pride, forgotten lust
No power lasts beyond the night
Justice comes to claim the right
