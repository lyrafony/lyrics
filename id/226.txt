[Verse 1]
The night is quiet, the world stands still,
Your whispers echo, they always will.
In every word, I hear your truth,
A secret language, our eternal youth.

[Pre-Chorus]
No need for shouting, no need for sound,
Your whispers wrap me safe and bound.

[Chorus]
Whisper it to me, soft and low,
Let the rhythm of your heart show.
Every breath you take, every word you say,
Turns my world to gold in every way.
Whisper it to me, let it be,
Your love is all I’ll ever need.

[Verse 2]
The stars are watching, but they can’t hear,
The sacred words that bring me near.
Your voice is fire, it burns so deep,
In your whispers, I fall asleep.

[Pre-Chorus]
No one else can hear what we create,
It’s our private world, a perfect state.

[Chorus]
Whisper it to me, soft and low,
Let the rhythm of your heart show.
Every breath you take, every word you say,
Turns my world to gold in every way.
Whisper it to me, let it be,
Your love is all I’ll ever need.

[Bridge]
Oh, the silence speaks louder than words,
In your whispers, I hear the chords.
Every note you sing, every sigh you give,
Makes me feel alive, makes me live.

[Final Chorus]
Whisper it to me, soft and low,
Let the rhythm of your heart show.
Every breath you take, every word you say,
Turns my world to gold in every way.
Whisper it to me, let it be,
Your love is all I’ll ever need.

[Outro]
Whisper it to me…
Forever yours, forever free…
