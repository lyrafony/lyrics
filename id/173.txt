[Verse 1]
They watch us from above,
Every move, every step,
Caught in the web they’ve spun,
No place to hide, no place to rest.

Screens light up the dark,
Invisible eyes on every street,
Every word we speak,
Every breath, they feel the heat.

[Chorus]
Eyes in the sky,
They see all that we do,
No escape, no freedom,
They’re always watching you.
Eyes in the sky,
They know what’s in your mind,
Bound by the wires,
We’re running out of time.

[Verse 2]
The cameras never blink,
Silent shadows watching us fall,
Whispers in the air,
Can’t trust a soul at all.

They track our every dream,
Data feeds the machine,
Where privacy’s a crime,
And we’re trapped in between.

[Chorus]
Eyes in the sky,
They see all that we do,
No escape, no freedom,
They’re always watching you.
Eyes in the sky,
They know what’s in your mind,
Bound by the wires,
We’re running out of time.

[Bridge]
Are we just a number in their game?
A pawn that they can blame?
We’re losing control,
In this world of shame.

[Chorus]
Eyes in the sky,
They see all that we do,
No escape, no freedom,
They’re always watching you.
Eyes in the sky,
They know what’s in your mind,
Bound by the wires,
We’re running out of time.

[Outro]
No place to hide,
No place to run,
The eyes are always on.
They’ll never be gone.
