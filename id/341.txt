[Verse 1]
There’s a glitch in the system, can’t you see?
A spark in the code that’s burning me.
I’m lost in a loop that never ends,
A world that bends, but can’t transcend.

[Pre-Chorus]
The rules are shifting, they fall apart,
I’m trapped in a world that’s cold at heart.
The glitch repeats, but I don’t mind,
It pulls me deeper, it fills my mind.

[Chorus]
Glitch in the system, can’t break free,
It’s holding on, it’s all I see.
A fractured world with no escape,
I’m lost in the glitch, can’t find my shape.

[Verse 2]
I hear the echoes, the static noise,
The glitch consumes, it’s all that destroys.
The walls are cracking, I feel the strain,
A broken world, a twisted chain.

[Bridge]
I’ll fight the glitch, but it’s in my veins,
A part of me now, it feeds the pains.
The system’s cracked, but I still remain,
A glitch in the system, forever chained.

[Chorus]
Glitch in the system, can’t break free,
It’s holding on, it’s all I see.
A fractured world with no escape,
I’m lost in the glitch, can’t find my shape.

[Outro]
I’ll live with the glitch, I’ll wear the mark,
In a world that’s shattered, I’ll leave my spark.
The system’s broken, but I’ll persist,
A glitch in the system, I still exist.
