[Verse 1]
A flicker dims inside my chest
A fragile flame that won’t find rest
The winds of doubt, they howl and bite
But still it fights, this faltering light

[Verse 2]
It wavers close to breaking free
Yet clings to what I cannot see
A truth that hides beyond the storm
A quiet place where hearts transform

[Chorus]
Faltering light, don’t fade away
Hold on through the night and stay
Though shadows stretch and doubts arise
I’ll keep faith with faltering light

[Verse 3]
The night is long, the path unsure
But something draws me to endure
Not certainty, but trust instead
A trembling hope inside my head

[Chorus]
Faltering light, don’t fade away
Hold on through the night and stay
Though shadows stretch and doubts arise
I’ll keep faith with faltering light

[Bridge]
No need for blaze or fiery show
Sometimes the smallest flames will grow
And when the dawn begins to rise
It’s born from faltering light’s surprise

[Final Chorus]
Faltering light, don’t fade away
Hold on through the night and stay
Though shadows stretch and doubts arise
I’ll keep faith with faltering light
