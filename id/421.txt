[Verse 1]
Step by step through fading light
I walk the path of endless night
The shadows stretch, they try to bind
But something calls from deep inside

[Verse 2]
Though doubts press hard and fears arise
I keep my gaze on distant skies
A silent voice begins to guide
Through every dark and restless tide

[Chorus]
Crossing shadows, moving slow
Finding strength I didn’t know
Though the night feels cold and long
I walk toward a quiet dawn

[Verse 3]
No promises of perfect days
Just steady steps and softened ways
The journey’s hard, but faith remains
A light that flickers through the rains

[Chorus]
Crossing shadows, moving slow
Finding strength I didn’t know
Though the night feels cold and long
I walk toward a quiet dawn

[Bridge]
Each shadow crossed, a step released
A heart once chained begins to cease
And in the distance, faint but clear
The dawn appears, the path sincere

[Final Chorus]
Crossing shadows, moving slow
Finding strength I didn’t know
Though the night feels cold and long
I walk toward a quiet dawn
