[Verse]
My dreams are shattered on the floor,
A thousand pieces, nothing more.
I built them high, but they all fell,
Now I’m lost in a broken shell.

[Chorus]
Shattered dreams, they haunt my mind,
Fragments left that I can’t find.
But in the wreckage, I will see,
A new hope rising inside of me.

[Verse]
The future seemed so clear to me,
But now it’s blurred, a mystery.
I search the dark for a glimpse of light,
To guide me through this endless night.

[Chorus]
Shattered dreams, they haunt my mind,
Fragments left that I can’t find.
But in the wreckage, I will see,
A new hope rising inside of me.

[Bridge]
I’ll pick up the pieces, one by one,
I’ll rebuild the dream that’s just begun.
The past may fall, but I will rise,
With shattered dreams, I’ll touch the skies.

[Chorus]
Shattered dreams, they haunt my mind,
Fragments left that I can’t find.
But in the wreckage, I will see,
A new hope rising inside of me.

[Outro]
The dream is broken, but not gone,
In the ruins, I’ll carry on.
