[Verse 1]
Flames may roar and winds may tear
But in the blaze, I know You’re there
Through trials fierce and shadows dire
I stand firm, my faith in fire

[Verse 2]
The heat consumes, the night is long
Yet in the fire, I grow strong
Not by sight, but heart’s desire
Sustained always by faith in fire

[Chorus]
Faith in the fire, burning bright
Guiding me through darkest night
Though flames may scorch and smoke may rise
I keep my trust beyond the skies

[Verse 3]
The furnace burns away my doubt
Refines my soul and all throughout
A quiet strength begins to grow
A faith no trial can overthrow

[Chorus]
Faith in the fire, burning bright
Guiding me through darkest night
Though flames may scorch and smoke may rise
I keep my trust beyond the skies

[Bridge]
When all is lost and hope seems dim
The fire’s light will not grow slim
A steady flame that lights the way
Through every night and into day

[Final Chorus]
Faith in the fire, burning bright
Guiding me through darkest night
Though flames may scorch and smoke may rise
I keep my trust beyond the skies
