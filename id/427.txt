[Verse 1]
Fields once green now stained with dust
Silent cries betray the trust
Broken lives beneath the sky
Where distant thunderâ€™s shadow lies

[Verse 2]
Echoes fade but scars remain
Invisible marks of pain
The cost unseen by those above
Yet felt below in loss and love

[Chorus]
Shadows of conflict stretch so wide
Haunting places where hope died
Though silence falls and wounds run deep
The soul remembers, will not sleep

[Verse 3]
The drumbeat fades, but still it calls
In empty streets and shattered walls
A whispered truth, a silent plea
For justice, peace, and dignity

[Chorus]
Shadows of conflict stretch so wide
Haunting places where hope died
Though silence falls and wounds run deep
The soul remembers, will not sleep

[Bridge]
Though darkness tries to hide the past
The light will come to heal at last
And through the pain, a strength will rise
To claim the dawn beyond the skies

[Final Chorus]
Shadows of conflict stretch so wide
Haunting places where hope died
Though silence falls and wounds run deep
The soul remembers, will not sleep
