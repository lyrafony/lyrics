[Verse 1]
In quiet halls, the silence cries
A broken heart that never lies
Screams unheard beneath the calm
A shattered soul, a hidden psalm

[Verse 2]
Searching light in shadows cast
Fading hope from days long past
Voices lure with sweet deceit
Leading lost to cold defeat

[Chorus]
Silent screams behind the eyes
Echoes lost in whispered lies
Haunted dreams and empty schemes
Trapped within these silent screams

[Verse 3]
Though none may hear the anguished call
The soul still yearns beyond the wall
For truth to break the chains of night
And bring the dawn, eternal light

[Chorus]
Silent screams behind the eyes
Echoes lost in whispered lies
Haunted dreams and empty schemes
Trapped within these silent screams

[Bridge]
Listen close, the spirit speaks
Through quiet tears and broken weeks
A call to rise, a path made clear
From silent screams to voices near

[Final Chorus]
Silent screams behind the eyes
Echoes lost in whispered lies
Haunted dreams and empty schemes
Trapped within these silent screams
