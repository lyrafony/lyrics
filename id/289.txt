[Verse 1]
I see the dawn, the horizon calls,
Beyond the mountains, past the falls.
The road is long, the path unclear,
But I′ll keep moving, shedding fear.

[Pre-Chorus]
Every step, I′m drawn to the light,
Chasing the sun, through the night.
No turning back, no end in sight,
The horizon’s calling, burning bright.

[Chorus]
Eternal horizon, lead me on,
Through the dark, until the dawn.
With every heartbeat, I’m reborn,
Chasing the light, till the world is gone.

[Verse 2]
Through the storms, I walk alone,
The wind is wild, but I′ve grown.
I hear the whispers of the past,
But I’ll keep moving, I’ll make it last.

[Pre-Chorus]
Every step, I′m drawn to the light,
Chasing the sun, through the night.
No turning back, no end in sight,
The horizon’s calling, burning bright.

[Chorus]
Eternal horizon, lead me on,
Through the dark, until the dawn.
With every heartbeat, I’m reborn,
Chasing the light, till the world is gone.

[Bridge]
Beyond the stars, I’ll find my way,
The future’s calling, a brand new day.
The horizon’s endless, so am I,
A warrior’s journey, to touch the sky.

[Chorus]
Eternal horizon, lead me on,
Through the dark, until the dawn.
With every heartbeat, I’m reborn,
Chasing the light, till the world is gone.
