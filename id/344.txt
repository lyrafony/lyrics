[Verse 1]
I feel the pulse, but it’s fading slow,
A broken rhythm that I used to know.
The beat was strong, but now it’s weak,
The world is silent, no words to speak.

[Pre-Chorus]
The wires crack, the signals die,
I try to reach, but I don’t know why.
The pulse is broken, the rhythm gone,
I stand alone, but I keep holding on.

[Chorus]
The broken pulse, can’t feel the beat,
A shattered world beneath my feet.
I’ll find my way through the empty night,
But the pulse is broken, fading from sight.

[Verse 2]
The clock ticks slow, the seconds freeze,
I’m searching for answers, but none to seize.
The rhythm’s lost, but I still fight,
I’ll find the pulse, in the dead of night.

[Bridge]
The silence grows, I can’t break through,
The pulse is broken, but I’ll renew.
I’ll fix the rhythm, I’ll start again,
A broken heart, but I’ll still ascend.

[Chorus]
The broken pulse, can’t feel the beat,
A shattered world beneath my feet.
I’ll find my way through the empty night,
But the pulse is broken, fading from sight.

[Outro]
I’ll fix the pulse, I’ll find the sound,
I’ll rise again from the broken ground.
The rhythm’s shattered, but I’ll restore,
The broken pulse will beat once more.
