[Verse 1]
The hours slip like grains of sand,
sliding through an unseen hand.
Moments blur, the past won’t stay,
the future rushes to today.

[Pre-Chorus]
I reach for seconds, they fade away,
time is a river I can’t obey.

[Chorus]
Falling through time, I lose my ground,
spinning in circles, no end found.
Yesterday’s gone, tomorrow’s unclear,
today is fleeting, it disappears.

[Verse 2]
Memories flicker like fading light,
dreams dissolve into the night.
Each step forward feels like a fall,
yet still I rise, defying it all.

[Bridge]
Time bends and breaks, it twists and turns,
lessons learned but never earned.
Though I can’t hold what’s running thin,
I’ll find myself within the spin.

[Final Section]
Falling through time, I lose my ground,
spinning in circles, no end found.
Yesterday’s gone, tomorrow’s unclear,
today is fleeting, it disappears.
