[Verse 1]
I wore the weight of a perfect disguise,
Smiling through the cracks where my soul would hide.
They handed me a throne made of glass and lies,
But I couldn’t see the cost until it all collapsed.

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I’m picking up the pieces,
Of who I was before they broke me.
This crown may be shattered,
But I’ll wear the scars with pride.

[Chorus]
I’m not afraid to fall, I’ve been here before,
A broken crown still shines on the coldest floors.
I’ll rise from the ashes, rebuild what they stole,
This is my fight, this is my broken soul.

[Verse 2]
The mirror shows a face I don’t recognize,
Eyes that burned so bright now reflect the skies.
But every tear I cried turned to fire in my veins,
And I won’t let them silence the sound of my name.

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I’m picking up the pieces,
Of who I was before they broke me.
This crown may be shattered,
But I’ll wear the scars with pride.

[Chorus]
I’m not afraid to fall, I’ve been here before,
A broken crown still shines on the coldest floors.
I’ll rise from the ashes, rebuild what they stole,
This is my fight, this is my broken soul.

[Bridge]
Oh, they tried to take my power,
Tried to dim the light within me.
But even in the darkest hour,
I found a strength I couldn’t see.
This crown may be broken,
But it’s still mine to hold.

[Final Chorus]
I’m not afraid to fall, I’ve been here before,
A broken crown still shines on the coldest floors.
I’ll rise from the ashes, rebuild what they stole,
This is my fight, this is my broken soul.

[Outro]
A broken crown, but I’m still standing tall,
Through every storm, I’ll never let it fall.
