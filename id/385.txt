[Verse 1]
Flickering fires in hollow halls
Empty shadows on broken walls
Chasing sparks that never last
A fleeting glow from ages past

[Verse 2]
Promises made with whispered lies
False light burning in darkened skies
Hands reach out for hollow gold
But find no warmth, just ash and cold

[Chorus]
False flames dance and fade away
Leading hearts so far astray
Empty fires, vain and cold
Truth remains, unbought, untold

[Verse 3]
Beneath the gleam, the darkness hides
A silent voice that warns and guides
Turn away from burning schemes
And seek the source of living streams

[Chorus]
False flames dance and fade away
Leading hearts so far astray
Empty fires, vain and cold
Truth remains, unbought, untold

[Bridge]
No flicker in the endless night
Can match the pure and holy light
That shines beyond the shadowsâ€™ claims
Unbroken by false flames

[Final Chorus]
False flames dance and fade away
Leading hearts so far astray
Empty fires, vain and cold
Truth remains, unbought, untold
