[Verse 1]
I see your shadow when I turn out the light,
A ghost in the mirror staring back tonight.
You look so familiar, but you’re not who I knew,
The face of my failures, the weight of what I do.

[Pre-Chorus]
But I won’t let you haunt me, I won’t let you win,
This is my reflection, but it’s not where I’ve been.
I’ll break every chain that you’ve wrapped around me,
The ghost in the mirror can’t keep me empty.

[Chorus]
I’m not afraid of the ghost in the glass,
It’s just a shadow of the person I was.
I’ll face the fear, I’ll fight the lies,
The mirror can’t hold me; I’m still alive.

[Verse 2]
Your whispers echo louder than they should,
A voice from the past that never did me good.
But I’m learning to silence the sound of your cries,
Every step I take leaves your shadow behind.

[Pre-Chorus]
But I won’t let you haunt me, I won’t let you win,
This is my reflection, but it’s not where I’ve been.
I’ll break every chain that you’ve wrapped around me,
The ghost in the mirror can’t keep me empty.

[Chorus]
I’m not afraid of the ghost in the glass,
It’s just a shadow of the person I was.
I’ll face the fear, I’ll fight the lies,
The mirror can’t hold me; I’m still alive.

[Bridge]
Oh, you tried to drag me down, pull me under your veil,
But I’m done with the darkness; I’m breaking the trail.
This is my moment, my time to ignite,
The ghost in the mirror fades into the light.

[Final Section]
I’m not afraid anymore, the shadows dissolve,
I’ve claimed my reflection, I’ve found the will.
The ghost in the mirror is gone, it’s clear,
I’ve faced my fears, and I have no fear.
