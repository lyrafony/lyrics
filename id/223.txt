[Verse 1]
The world feels lighter, the air turns gold,
Every step we take is a story told.
Your laughter dances in my soul,
You make me whole, you make me whole.

[Pre-Chorus]
When you’re near, the shadows fade,
Every moment feels like it’s made to stay.

[Chorus]
When you’re with me, the stars align,
The rhythm of life feels so divine.
In your embrace, I find my home,
With you, my love, I’m never alone.
When you’re with me, the night ignites,
Our hearts are dancing under the lights.

[Verse 2]
The moonlight whispers, the ocean sings,
Your touch is magic, it makes my heart swing.
No words are needed, no need to explain,
With you, my love, there’s no more pain.

[Pre-Chorus]
Every heartbeat echoes your name,
Together we’re playing a perfect game.

[Chorus]
When you’re with me, the stars align,
The rhythm of life feels so divine.
In your embrace, I find my home,
With you, my love, I’m never alone.
When you’re with me, the night ignites,
Our hearts are dancing under the lights.

[Bridge]
Oh, the world can spin, the skies can fall,
But with you, I’ll never feel small.
Your love’s a fire, burning so bright,
It turns my darkness into light.

[Final Chorus]
When you’re with me, the stars align,
The rhythm of life feels so divine.
In your embrace, I find my home,
With you, my love, I’m never alone.
When you’re with me, the night ignites,
Our hearts are dancing under the lights.

[Outro]
When you’re with me…
I’m where I’m meant to be.
