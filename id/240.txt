[Verse]
I see the light fading slow,
Shadows dance where dreams once flowed.
A whisper calls from far away,
Guiding me through the gray.

[Chorus]
Beyond the horizon, I’ll find my way,
Through the silence, I hear you say—
“Hold on, keep moving, don’t let go,
The stars will guide you through the glow.”

[Verse]
Time dissolves like waves in flight,
Every moment feels so right.
In the dark, I feel alive,
Chasing echoes, learning to thrive.

[Bridge]
Ohhh… ohhh…
Carry me higher, closer to fire…
Ohhh… ohhh…
Let the rhythm take control…

[Outro]
We rise, we fall, we learn to fly,
Under endless skies, we touch the light.
Forever searching, forever free,
This is who we’re meant to be.
