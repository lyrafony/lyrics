[Intro]
I hear the echoes of tomorrow…
Whispers in the wind, tellin’ me to follow.

[Verse 1]
I’ve been walkin′ through the storm, caught in the rain,
But I keep movin′ forward, despite all the pain.
The world’s movin’ fast, but I’m tryna catch up,
Chasin’ dreams that seem to be never enough.

But I hear the voices in the back of my mind,
Tellin′ me the future’s brighter, I just need to find.
A reason to keep goin′, a reason to stay,
I’m listenin′ to the echoes, they show me the way.

[Pre-Chorus]
Echoes of tomorrow, they call my name,
Puttin’ all the past mistakes to shame.
The future’s so clear, I can feel it in my soul,
I’m lettin’ go of the fear, I’m ready to roll.

[Chorus]
Ohhh, echoes of tomorrow,
Lead me through the pain, past the sorrow.
Ohhh, I’m chasin′ the light,
The echoes of tomorrow, they shine so bright.

[Verse 2]
I used to be lost, driftin′ in the dark,
But I found my way, ignited the spark.
Now I’m standin′ tall, I’m takin’ the lead,
Listenin′ to the echoes, fulfillin′ the need.

The world’s in motion, but I’m in control,
I’m chasin’ tomorrow, and I’m on a roll.
No more second-guessin’, I’m takin’ the chance,
The echoes are loud, it’s time to advance.

[Pre-Chorus]
Echoes of tomorrow, they call my name,
Puttin’ all the past mistakes to shame.
The future’s so clear, I can feel it in my soul,
I’m lettin’ go of the fear, I’m ready to roll.

[Chorus]
Ohhh, echoes of tomorrow,
Lead me through the pain, past the sorrow.
Ohhh, I’m chasin′ the light,
The echoes of tomorrow, they shine so bright.

[Bridge]
In the echoes, I find my way,
I’ll make it through, no matter what they say.

[Verse 3]
The road’s not easy, but I’m not afraid,
I hear the echoes callin′, they’ve got it made.
I’m movin′ forward, no lookin′ back,
The future’s wide open, and I’m on track.

[Outro]
Echoes of tomorrow… guiding me…
To a place where I’m finally free…
