[Verse]
I stand at the edge, looking down,
A void below, no light around.
The silence screams inside my mind,
A place I can’t escape, I find.

[Chorus]
Into the void, I drift alone,
Lost in the dark, I’ve never known.
The world is quiet, but it’s loud inside,
In this endless space, I cannot hide.

[Verse]
I’ve searched for answers, none to find,
The void consumes, it clouds my mind.
But in this dark, I feel the pull,
A weightless dance, both free and cruel.

[Chorus]
Into the void, I drift alone,
Lost in the dark, I’ve never known.
The world is quiet, but it’s loud inside,
In this endless space, I cannot hide.

[Bridge]
And though the void feels like the end,
It’s here that I begin to mend.
In the darkness, I learn to see,
The pieces of the person I’ll be.

[Chorus]
Into the void, I drift alone,
Lost in the dark, I’ve never known.
The world is quiet, but it’s loud inside,
In this endless space, I cannot hide.

[Outro]
And when I fall into the night,
I’ll find my way, I’ll find the light.
