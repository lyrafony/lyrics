[Verse 1]
No voice to break the heavy air
Just empty space and vacant prayer
A veil of silence wraps the soul
Where questions drown and doubts control

[Verse 2]
I reach for signs that never come
A whispered word, a gentle drum
But all that greets me is the hush
A quiet vast, a pressing crush

[Chorus]
Veil of silence, thick and cold
A test of faith, a story told
In absence felt but not yet seen
The space between what might have been

[Verse 3]
Though silence looms, I stand my ground
In stillness where no answers sound
For in this quiet, strength is born
A faith that waits to greet the morn

[Chorus]
Veil of silence, thick and cold
A test of faith, a story told
In absence felt but not yet seen
The space between what might have been

[Bridge]
Though deafening, the silent cry
Is where the soul learns how to fly
And through the void, the heart will soar
To find the light behind the door

[Final Chorus]
Veil of silence, thick and cold
A test of faith, a story told
In absence felt but not yet seen
The space between what might have been
