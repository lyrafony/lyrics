[Verse 1]
I was born to break the mold, they can’t keep me in line,
I’m a spark in the dark, I’m a shot through the sky.
Every rule they wrote for me, I’ll just tear apart,
I’ve got gasoline dreams and a fire in my heart.

[Pre-Chorus]
They can try to shut me down, but I’ll never comply,
I’ll burn brighter than their lies with my rebel battle cry.
This is who I am, take it or leave,
I won’t change for anyone, I won’t grieve.

[Chorus]
I’ve got a rebel soul, I’ll never conform,
I’ll fight till I’m free in this crazy storm.
They can call me wild, they can call me insane,
But I’ll wear my scars like a badge of flame.
I’ve got a rebel soul, I’ll never back down,
I’ll rise from the ashes and take this town.

[Verse 2]
The system tried to crush me, but I’m still alive,
Every wound they gave me just made me thrive.
I’m the voice of the silenced, the spark of the fight,
And I’ll scream at the top of my lungs through the night.

[Pre-Chorus]
They can try to shut me down, but I’ll never comply,
I’ll burn brighter than their lies with my rebel battle cry.
This is who I am, take it or leave,
I won’t change for anyone, I won’t grieve.

[Chorus]
I’ve got a rebel soul, I’ll never conform,
I’ll fight till I’m free in this crazy storm.
They can call me wild, they can call me insane,
But I’ll wear my scars like a badge of flame.
I’ve got a rebel soul, I’ll never back down,
I’ll rise from the ashes and take this town.

[Bridge]
Oh, they can throw their hate, but it won’t break my stride,
I’ll keep marching forward with fire in my side.
This is my revolution, my anthem, my art,
I’ll never surrender, I’m a rebel at heart.

[Final Chorus]
I’ve got a rebel soul, I’ll never conform,
I’ll fight till I’m free in this crazy storm.
They can call me wild, they can call me insane,
But I’ll wear my scars like a badge of flame.
I’ve got a rebel soul, I’ll never back down,
I’ll rise from the ashes and take this town.
