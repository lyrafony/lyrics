[Verse 1]
Wrapped within a veil unseen
A mantle soft, serene,
A shelter from the storm’s embrace
A refuge built on boundless grace

[Verse 2]
No earthly shield could match its might
Nor shadows dark obscure its light
A gentle strength that guards the soul
And makes the broken spirit whole

[Chorus]
Mantle of grace, a sacred fold
A warmth that heals, a hand to hold
In every trial, through every night
A cloak of peace, a holy light

[Verse 3]
When weary hearts begin to stray
The mantle guides, shows forth the way
With quiet power, soft and true
A faith renewed, a life made new

[Chorus]
Mantle of grace, a sacred fold
A warmth that heals, a hand to hold
In every trial, through every night
A cloak of peace, a holy light

[Bridge]
Beyond the reach of time’s demand
It holds the soul with gentle hand
A promise kept, a bond embraced
Forever wrapped in endless grace

[Final Chorus]
Mantle of grace, a sacred fold
A warmth that heals, a hand to hold
In every trial, through every night
A cloak of peace, a holy light
