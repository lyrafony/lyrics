Title: Fractured Code

[Verse 1]
I live inside a broken code,
A life that′s written, never told.
The lines are twisted, the paths unclear,
I try to follow, but I disappear.

[Pre-Chorus]
The signals fade, the rules collide,
I fight the code that I can′t hide.
It takes control, but I resist,
A fractured life that can’t exist.

[Chorus]
Fractured code, it pulls me in,
A game I play, but I can’t win.
The system’s broken, but I’ll fight,
I’ll break the code and find the light.

[Verse 2]
The algorithms, they dictate,
My every move, my twisted fate.
I try to rewrite, but it’s too late,
I’m stuck inside a locked-out state.

[Bridge]
The code is cracked, the lines distort,
A fractured mind, a broken port.
I’ll fight the system, tear it down,
Rebuild my world, erase the sound.

[Chorus]
Fractured code, it pulls me in,
A game I play, but I can’t win.
The system’s broken, but I’ll fight,
I’ll break the code and find the light.

[Outro]
The code is fractured, but I’ll break,
Rebuild my life for freedom’s sake.
No more rules, no more chains,
I’ll rewrite the code, break the reins.
