[Verse 1]
They gather close with eyes so wide
Their words like knives, their hearts denied
Quick to judge and slow to care
A thousand mouths, but none to bear

[Verse 2]
They sing aloud in practiced tone
But leave the grieving soul alone
No burden shared, no tear embraced
Just hollow talk in holy place

[Chorus]
Voices in the crowd, so loud, so vain
Drenched in pride, but numb to pain
They speak of light, but walk in cloud
Lost beneath the voices in the crowd

[Verse 3]
When truth is raw, they turn away
And scorn the ones who dare to stay
With open wounds and honest cries
They cast them out with quiet lies

[Chorus]
Voices in the crowd, so loud, so vain
Drenched in pride, but numb to pain
They speak of light, but walk in cloud
Lost beneath the voices in the crowd

[Bridge]
A whisper breaks the noise apart
A call that reaches to the heart
Not found in masses wrapped in fame
But in the One who knows your name

[Final Chorus]
Voices in the crowd, so loud, so vain
Drenched in pride, but numb to pain
They speak of light, but walk in cloud
But truth outlives the voices in the crowd
