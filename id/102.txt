[Verse 1]
The clock keeps ticking, relentless and cold,
Its hands move forward, a story untold.
Moments slip through like grains of sand,
Falling quiet from an unseen hand.
I’ve chased the hours, tried to make them stay,
But time just whispers, “I’m here then I fade.”
Now I wonder if I’ve used it well,
Or let it vanish under life’s spell.

[Pre-Chorus]
It’s hard to hold what you can’t contain,
To pause the rhythm or ease the strain.
But maybe time isn’t ours to own,
Just a fleeting gift we’re asked to hone.

[Chorus]
Time moves softly, yet leaves its mark,
A river flowing through light and dark.
Every second shapes who we are,
Each heartbeat echoes near and far.
We can’t rewind, but we can begin,
To live with purpose, let love seep in.
This moment matters, it’s all we have,
So build your legacy where dreams still stand.

[Verse 2]
I’ve wasted days on worry and fear,
On chasing shadows instead of clear.
Regret creeps in when nights grow long,
For moments lost, for paths gone wrong.
Yet even now, there’s time to mend,
To write new chapters, to transcend.
The past may linger, but it doesn’t bind,
The future waits for a present aligned.

[Pre-Chorus]
It’s hard to hold what you can’t contain,
To pause the rhythm or ease the strain.
To pause the rhythm or ease the strain.
But maybe time isn’t ours to own,
Just a fleeting gift we’re asked to hone.

[Chorus]
Time moves softly, yet leaves its mark,
A river flowing through light and dark.
Every second shapes who we are,
Each heartbeat echoes near and far.
We can’t rewind, but we can begin,
To live with purpose, let love seep in.
This moment matters, it’s all we have,
So build your legacy where dreams still stand.
