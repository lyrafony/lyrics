[Verse 1]
Fractured ties and silent walls
Echoes of forgotten calls
Promises made then cast away
Trust dissolved in shades of gray

[Verse 2]
Hands once joined now pulled apart
Coldness settled in the heart
Words of love turned into chains
Binding hearts with silent pains

[Chorus]
Broken bonds, shattered trust
Fading faith and dreams unjust
Walls arise where bridges fall
Lonely souls behind the wall

[Verse 3]
The ties that bind were meant to heal
Now broken wounds refuse to seal
Yet hope remains beyond the night
For mending bonds and setting right

[Chorus]
Broken bonds, shattered trust
Fading faith and dreams unjust
Walls arise where bridges fall
Lonely souls behind the wall

[Bridge]
Reach beyond the fractured past
Build anew, let love outlast
Heal the breach, restore the way
And bring the dawn of brighter days

[Final Chorus]
Broken bonds, shattered trust
Fading faith and dreams unjust
Walls arise where bridges fall
Lonely souls behind the wall
