[Verse 1]
Every step feels sharp and thin
Like walking on glass, afraid to begin
The cracks beneath whisper my name
Fragile and worn, caught in the flame

[Verse 2]
The weight of the world bends my knees
A thousand wounds no one sees
But in the silence between the cracks
Something steady keeps me intact

[Chorus]
Walking on glass, I tread so light
Holding on through the darkest night
Though every step could break me down
There’s a strength I have never found
It’s not in me, but it holds me fast
Walking on glass, I’ll make it last

[Verse 3]
Fear tries to push, doubt tries to pull
The edges sharp, the nights so cruel
Yet I rise each time I fall
Because something catches my call

[Chorus]
Walking on glass, I tread so light
Holding on through the darkest night
Though every step could break me down
There’s a strength I have never found
It’s not in me, but it holds me fast
Walking on glass, I’ll make it last

[Bridge]
Not all battles are loud or bright
Some are won in quiet fight
A fragile heart that won’t let go
Of hope no one else could know

[Final Chorus]
Walking on glass, I tread so light
Holding on through the darkest night
Though every step could break me down
There’s a strength I have never found
It’s not in me, but it holds me fast
Walking on glass, I’ll make it last
