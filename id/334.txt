[Verse]
I’ve seen the cracks in the perfect lie,
The code’s corrupted, I can’t deny.
The world I know is fading fast,
A glitch in the system, too big to last.

[Chorus]
There’s a glitch in the code, can’t you see?
The world is crumbling, breaking free.
What’s real, what’s fake? I can’t decide,
A glitch in the code where I can’t hide.

[Verse]
I hear the static in the air,
A distorted signal everywhere.
The rules are breaking, falling apart,
A world that’s shattered, tearing my heart.

[Chorus]
There’s a glitch in the code, can’t you see?
The world is crumbling, breaking free.
What’s real, what’s fake? I can’t decide,
A glitch in the code where I can’t hide.

[Bridge]
The lines blur, the vision’s skewed,
The system’s failing, I’m being subdued.
I’ve lost control, I’ve lost my mind,
Trapped in a world that’s left behind.

[Chorus]
There’s a glitch in the code, can’t you see?
The world is crumbling, breaking free.
What’s real, what’s fake? I can’t decide,
A glitch in the code where I can’t hide.

[Outro]
A glitch in the code, it’s all a lie,
But I’ll keep searching, reaching for the sky.
