[Verse 1]
We met at the wrong time, wrong place, wrong story
I saw you, and for a second, it felt like glory
But life had its way, pulling us apart
I wonder if we could’ve been, if we had a fresh start

[Pre-Chorus]
In another life, we’d be everything
Maybe we'd have had the love we never got to sing
In another world, it could be just you and me
A perfect love, a perfect harmony

[Chorus]
In another life, we’d be the one
No more waiting, no more being undone
We'd be free, no walls between
A love that could've been, a love unseen
In another life, you’d be mine
And I’d be yours, in perfect time

[Verse 2]
We tried our best, but we were just too late
The world had its own plans, sealed our fate
If things had been different, if we had the chance
Would we have danced in this timeless romance?

[Pre-Chorus]
In another life, we’d be everything
Maybe we'd have had the love we never got to sing
In another world, it could be just you and me
A perfect love, a perfect harmony

[Chorus]
In another life, we’d be the one
No more waiting, no more being undone
We'd be free, no walls between
A love that could've been, a love unseen
In another life, you’d be mine
And I’d be yours, in perfect time

[Bridge]
We were so close, yet so far apart
The distance between us was miles of heart
But maybe in another world, we’ll meet again
And this time, we’ll have the love we were meant to begin

[Chorus]
In another life, we’d be the one
No more waiting, no more being undone
We'd be free, no walls between
A love that could've been, a love unseen
In another life, you’d be mine
And I’d be yours, in perfect time

[Outro]
In another life...
In another life...
You’d be mine...
