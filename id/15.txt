[Verse]
I light my cigarette, I feel their eyes,
Disgust in their gaze, they criticize.
They pull out their phones, ready to film,
Thinking they’re saints, while the world’s growing dim.

[Verse]
You point your fingers, you act so pure,
But behind your phones, the truth’s obscure.
How many hands bled just for your screen,
While you sip your latte, living your dream?

[Pre-Chorus]
They sell you “green” and “sustainable lies,”
But it’s all built on the earth’s demise.
They dress in “eco-friendly” clothes,
While they poison the air, everybody knows.

[Chorus]
It’s all a lie, it’s all a show,
They sell you peace, but chaos grows.
They talk about change, about saving the trees,
But they’re just selling you more disease.

[Verse]
You used to see people smoking in peace,
Now you judge me like I’m the disease.
You drive your car, you wear your brand,
But you turn a blind eye to the suffering hand.

[Verse]
They sell their products with a smile so wide,
“Eco-friendly,” they say, but the truth they hide.
Destruction wrapped in shiny green,
Pretend to be saving, but they’re part of the scheme.

[Pre-Chorus]
You think you're saving the earth with your ways,
But you’re part of the system that never decays.
You recycle, you shop, but what’s really done?
Nothing’s changing, you’re just another pawn.

[Chorus]
It’s all a lie, it’s all a game,
Selling you hope, while they take the blame.
They talk about change, about saving the seas,
But they’re just selling you more disease.

[Verse]
You buy your bags, thinking you're wise,
But you’re still trapped in their grand disguise.
You say you care, you’re part of the cause,
But your actions still feed their applause.
