[Verse 1]
I hear it calling in the dead of night,
A roaring sound that sets my soul alight.
The world can try to hold me down,
But I’m chasing thunder, I won’t back down.

[Pre-Chorus]
Every step I take shakes the ground beneath,
I’m done with silence, I’ve found my release.
The storm is waiting, it’s pulling me near,
I’ll run through the fire, I’ve got no fear.

[Chorus]
I’m chasing thunder, running wild and free,
Breaking every chain, rewriting my destiny.
The sky is falling, but I’m reaching higher,
I’ll dance with the lightning, I’ll play with the fire.

[Verse 2]
They told me dreams were made of empty air,
But I can feel the storm alive in my hair.
Every heartbeat screams, “This is who you are,”
I’ll ride the chaos like a shooting star.

[Pre-Chorus]
Every step I take shakes the ground beneath,
I’m done with silence, I’ve found my release.
The storm is waiting, it’s pulling me near,
I’ll run through the fire, I’ve got no fear.

[Chorus]
I’m chasing thunder, running wild and free,
Breaking every chain, rewriting my destiny.
The sky is falling, but I’m reaching higher,
I’ll dance with the lightning, I’ll play with the fire.

[Bridge]
Oh, they can try to stop me, but they’ll never win,
I was born to chase the storm within.
The thunder calls, it’s in my veins,
I’ll rise above the rain.

[Final Chorus]
I’m chasing thunder, running wild and free,
Breaking every chain, rewriting my destiny.
The sky is falling, but I’m reaching higher,
I’ll dance with the lightning, I’ll play with the fire.

[Outro]
Chasing thunder, I’ll never slow down,
I’ll keep on running till I wear the crown.
The storm is mine, I’ll make it start,
Forever chasing thunder with my fearless heart.
