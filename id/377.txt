[Verse 1]
I used to think that strong meant steel
No tears, no cracks, no time to feel
But I have bled through quiet nights
And found my fight in softer lights

[Verse 2]
It’s not the shout that makes me whole
But standing still when storms roll
It’s not the wall that proves I’m brave
But knowing when I need to cave

[Chorus]
This fragile strength, it bends, not breaks
It carries pain the proud forsake
It doesn’t roar, it doesn’t shine
But holds the line with hands like mine

[Verse 3]
It walks through fire, not to boast
But to be near what matters most
It speaks in sighs, in whispered breath
And keeps its vow in face of death

[Chorus]
This fragile strength, it bends, not breaks
It carries pain the proud forsake
It doesn’t roar, it doesn’t shine
But holds the line with hands like mine

[Bridge]
I’m learning now what strength can be
To break in light and still be free
To face the wound and not defend
To lose the fight and still ascend

[Final Chorus]
This fragile strength, it bends, not breaks
It heals with scars, it gives, it takes
And though the world may call it weak
It holds the truth the strong still seek
