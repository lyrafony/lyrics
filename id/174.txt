[Verse 1]
In the silence of the night,
I can feel the weight of the watchful eye,
Every move I make,
Is mapped and saved, there′s nowhere to hide.

I walk the streets,
But the streets are never mine,
A shadow follows me,
Tracking every line.

[Chorus]
Tracked and trapped, can’t break free,
Caught in the web of their technology.
Locked in this cage, it’s hard to breathe,
Tracked and trapped, it’s all I’ll ever be.

[Verse 2]
They know my name,
They know my face,
Every step I take,
I’m in their database.

They see my thoughts,
Before I speak,
I’m just a number now,
Lost and weak.

[Chorus]
Tracked and trapped, can’t break free,
Caught in the web of their technology.
Locked in this cage, it’s hard to breathe,
Tracked and trapped, it’s all I’ll ever be.

[Bridge]
The walls are closing in,
No place left to run,
I’ve become a prisoner,
In a world that’s never done.

[Chorus]
Tracked and trapped, can’t break free,
Caught in the web of their technology.
Locked in this cage, it’s hard to breathe,
Tracked and trapped, it’s all I’ll ever be.

[Outro]
Tracked and trapped, forever bound,
I’m just a ghost in this silent sound.
Tracked and trapped, I’m lost inside,
I can never escape, there’s nowhere to hide.
