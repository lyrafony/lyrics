[Verse 1]
I see through every word you say,
same old stories, same old games.
Took me time to realize,
but now I see through all your lies!

[Pre-Chorus]
No more whispers in the dark,
no more playing with my heart.
I’ve been blind, but now I see,
this time you won’t fool me!

[Chorus]
No more lies, no more pain,
I’m breaking free, I’m done with your game!
Took my heart, took my time,
but you can’t take what’s left inside!

[Verse 2]
You swore that you would never change,
but every promise sounds the same.
I’m not the fool I used to be,
tonight I’m walking out, I’m free!

[Pre-Chorus]
No more whispers in the dark,
no more playing with my heart.
I’ve been blind, but now I see,
this time you won’t fool me!

[Chorus]
No more lies, no more pain,
I’m breaking free, I’m done with your game!
Took my heart, took my time,
but you can’t take what’s left inside!

[Bridge]
Turn the page, walk away,
nothing left for me to say.
I won’t fall, I won’t break,
I know now what’s real, what’s fake!

[Final Chorus]
No more lies, no more pain,
I’m breaking free, I’m done with your game!
Took my heart, took my time,
but you can’t take what’s left inside!
