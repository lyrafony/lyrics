[Verse]
They told you I was the enemy, when all I wanted was your trust,
They fed you lies about me, made you think I wasn’t just.
We used to stand together, now we’re miles apart,
They made you see me as a threat, when I was here from the start.

[Verse]
You started seeing value in what you could gain,
Looking for the next one who could take away your pain.
You think love’s a transaction, not something pure and true,
But I won’t play that game, I won’t bend for you.

[Pre-Chorus]
They taught us to fear each other, turned us into foes,
What we had was real, but now it’s lost in the show.

[Chorus]
They separated us on purpose, did it perfectly,
Told you I’m your enemy, and now you’re blind to see.
But when the mask falls, and truth starts to show,
Love’s been replaced, now we’re just shadows below.

[Verse]
They sold you the idea that love’s a game of gain,
Taught you to seek money, not a heart to sustain.
And now we stand divided, our love’s been erased,
You look for someone who fits the roles they’ve placed.

[Bridge]
It wasn’t a mistake, it was a plan designed,
To control our hearts and make us blind.

[Pre-Chorus]
They taught us to fear each other, turned us into foes,
What we had was real, but now it’s lost in the show.

[Chorus]
They separated us on purpose, did it perfectly,
Told you I’m your enemy, and now you’re blind to see.
But when the mask falls, and truth starts to show,
Love’s been replaced, now we’re just shadows below.
