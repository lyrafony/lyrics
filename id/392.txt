[Verse 1]
Once they shone with borrowed light
Guiding lost through endless night
But every star will lose its glow
When truth begins to overflow

[Verse 2]
False constellations, forged in lies
Built on dreams that fade and die
Hearts entranced by empty gleam
Bound within a broken dream

[Chorus]
Fallen stars, lost in time
Shattered lies, fading rhyme
False guides lost in the haze
Broken paths and empty days

[Verse 3]
No star can hold eternal flame
All must bow to truthâ€™s great name
From ashes rise a light anew
One that burns forever true

[Chorus]
Fallen stars, lost in time
Shattered lies, fading rhyme
False guides lost in the haze
Broken paths and empty days

[Bridge]
Look beyond the starlit sky
Seek the source that will not die
A light eternal, pure and bright
Breaking through the endless night

[Final Chorus]
Fallen stars, lost in time
Shattered lies, fading rhyme
False guides lost in the haze
Broken paths and empty days
