[Verse 1]
The door is slowly closing, but I’m still holding on
We’ve been here for hours, but I feel so alone
I know it’s time to go, but my heart won’t let me leave
The silence is louder than the words we didn’t say

[Pre-Chorus]
I’m trying to find a way to keep you near
But the closer I get, the more you disappear
I wish we could freeze this moment in time
But deep inside, I know we’ve crossed the line

[Chorus]
I don’t want to say goodbye
But your eyes, they tell me why
All we have is slipping through our hands
And I’m stuck in the end of our plans
I don’t want to walk away
But I know it’s the price we’ll pay
I don’t want to say goodbye
But it’s the only thing left to try

[Verse 2]
I see your face and the tears that never fall
You’re holding back your heart, afraid to give it all
We used to dream of forever, now it’s just a past
I wish I could stop time, make this moment last

[Pre-Chorus]
I’m trying to find a way to keep you near
But the closer I get, the more you disappear
I wish we could freeze this moment in time
But deep inside, I know we’ve crossed the line

[Chorus]
I don’t want to say goodbye
But your eyes, they tell me why
All we have is slipping through our hands
And I’m stuck in the end of our plans
I don’t want to walk away
But I know it’s the price we’ll pay
I don’t want to say goodbye
But it’s the only thing left to try

[Bridge]
And I’ll keep holding on, hoping for a change
But deep inside I know that we’ve both changed
I don’t want this to end, I want to stay
But it’s the only choice we have to make

[Chorus]
I don’t want to say goodbye
But your eyes, they tell me why
All we have is slipping through our hands
And I’m stuck in the end of our plans
I don’t want to walk away
But I know it’s the price we’ll pay
I don’t want to say goodbye
But it’s the only thing left to try

[Outro]
Goodbye…
I don’t want to say goodbye
But it’s time…
