[Intro]
Steel in my blood, fire in my gaze,
Through every storm, I carve my ways.
The weight of the world bends but never breaks,
In iron veins, my spirit wakes.

[Verse 1]
They tried to shatter what they couldn’t see,
But every strike forged who I’m meant to be.
The cracks they left became my shield,
A warrior’s heart no force can yield.

[Pre-Chorus]
This strength was born in the fiercest flame,
Baptized by pain, but never ashamed.

[Chorus]
Iron veins run deep inside,
No force on earth can turn the tide.
Through every blow, I grow more whole,
A soul of steel with endless goals.

[Verse 2]→
The scars that linger tell my tale,
Of battles fought and dreams set sail.
Each wound a lesson, each tear a spark,
Lighting the way through endless dark.

[Pre-Chorus]
This strength was born in the fiercest flame,
Baptized by pain, but never ashamed.

[Chorus]
Iron veins run deep inside,
No force on earth can turn the tide.
Through every blow, I grow more whole,
A soul of steel with endless goals.

[Bridge]
Let the storms rage, let the tempests roar,
I’ll stand unbroken, forevermore.
The forge is hot, the hammer falls,
But iron veins will never stall.

[Final Chorus]
Iron veins defy the test of time,
Built from ashes, now I climb.
Through every trial, I rise anew,
A fortress strong, my spirit true.
