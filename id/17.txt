[Verse]
You post your life like it's a dream so grand,
But we all know the truth behind your hand.
Dubai’s your stage, but it's not what it seems,
Sponsored trips to feed your shallow dreams.

[Verse]
You kiss their lips just to sell your soul,
Let them humiliate you, make you lose control.
You flaunt your wealth like you’re on top of the game,
But deep inside, you’re hiding all your shame.

[Pre-Chorus]
You’ve got the followers, the likes, the fame,
But at what cost? You’ve lost your name.

[Chorus]
Take off the mask that you wear so high,
We see through it all, no need to lie.
Wanting the world to see you shine,
But you're breaking yourself in the name of the grind.

We want the best for you, don’t you see?
Let go of the pain, come back to be free.
Return to the peace you used to know,
Before the world made you put on a show.

[Verse]
You act like you’re above it all,
But we can tell, you're just waiting for a fall.
You sell your skin, pretend you're empowered,
But inside, you're crumbling, feeling devoured.

[Verse]
Is this the life you really chose?
Or did they make you lose the path you once rose?
You’re worth more than this, more than they’ve told,
Stop selling your soul for things that are cold.

[Pre-Chorus]
You’ve got the followers, the likes, the fame,
But at what cost? You’ve lost your name.

[Chorus]
Take off the mask that you wear so high,
We see through it all, no need to lie.
Wanting the world to see you shine,
But you're breaking yourself in the name of the grind.
