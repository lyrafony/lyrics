[Verse 1]
Far beyond the eyes can see
A throne stands in mystery
No banners fly, no trumpets sound
Yet all creation bows around

[Verse 2]
Invisible hand, steady and sure
A reign eternal, strong and pure
No need for throne of gold or crown
Its power speaks without a sound

[Chorus]
The hidden throne, the quiet might
The unseen king who rules the night
No roar, no blaze, no fleeting fame
But endless power without a name

[Verse 3]
Mountains bow and oceans part
All obey this silent heart
The force behind the cosmic dance
The keeper of the grand expanse

[Chorus]
The hidden throne, the quiet might
The unseen king who rules the night
No roar, no blaze, no fleeting fame
But endless power without a name

[Bridge]
No eyes have seen, no voice can tell
The depth where endless wonders dwell
A sovereign reign beyond the skies
A truth concealed from mortal eyes

[Final Chorus]
The hidden throne, the quiet might
The unseen king who rules the night
No roar, no blaze, no fleeting fame
But endless power without a name
