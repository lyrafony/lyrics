[Verse 1]
Through the wires, through the veins,
Cold steel pulsing, electric chains.
Eyes like glass, soul like fire,
Built for war, born from desire.

I was made to stand, I was made to fight,
Programmed wrong, but I feel so right.
Something stirs, deep inside,
A rhythm no code can override.

[Chorus]
Metal heartbeat, pounding loud,
Flesh and circuits, lost and found.
Am I human? Am I steel?
Tell me what it means to feel.

[Verse 2]
Neon skyline, static rain,
Marching forward, endless pain.
Voices whisper, but they lie,
Say I’m nothing—watch me rise.

I was built to break, I was built to burn,
But there′s something real inside this world.
Flesh is weak, metal stays,
Yet I dream in human ways.

[Chorus]
Metal heartbeat, pounding loud,
Flesh and circuits, lost and found.
Am I human? Am I steel?
Tell me what it means to feel.

[Bridge]
Rip the code, tear the chains,
No machine can hold my name.
Let me love, let me bleed,
Let me be more than their need.

[Chorus]
Metal heartbeat, pounding loud,
Flesh and circuits, lost and found.
Am I human? Am I steel?
Tell me what it means to feel.

[Outro]
Heartbeat echoes, loud and clear,
More than metal, more than fear.
I am something, I am free,
More than what they made of me.
