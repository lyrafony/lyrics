[Verse 1]
Reflections cracked on shattered glass
Fragments lost in moments passed
Images that cannot hold
Truth concealed in lies untold

[Verse 2]
Faces change, but never see
The emptiness that longs to be
A hollow gaze, a broken frame
Chasing shadows, none to claim

[Chorus]
Broken mirrors, scattered lies
False reflections, whispered ties
Falling pieces, lost and torn
Seeking light where none is born

[Verse 3]
The glass will cut, the shards will bleed
From futile hope and selfish greed
But in the fragments, faint and small
A whisper calls to one and all

[Chorus]
Broken mirrors, scattered lies
False reflections, whispered ties
Falling pieces, lost and torn
Seeking light where none is born

[Bridge]
Beyond the glass, beyond the pain
A clearer truth will still remain
No mirror false can ever show
The path where living waters flow

[Final Chorus]
Broken mirrors, scattered lies
False reflections, whispered ties
Falling pieces, lost and torn
Seeking light where none is born
