[Verse 1]
I’ve walked the edge of dreams I couldn’t see,
Chasing stars that burned too far for me.
But every road I’ve traveled, every tear I’ve cried,
Led me closer to the light where shadows die.

The sky is vast, the night feels endless now,
But I can feel the pulse of something sacred somehow.
Through the static noise, a voice begins to call,
Beyond the limits, there’s a world that’s waiting for us all.

[Chorus]
Infinite horizons, stretching far and wide,
A canvas painted with the colors of the tide.
No matter how far, no matter how long,
The journey’s in my heart, it’s where I belong.

[Verse 2]
Neon skies reflect the fire in my veins,
Every heartbeat echoes through the empty plains.
I’ve faced the storm, I’ve danced with doubt before,
But every step I take unlocks another door.

The future whispers, “You’re not bound by time,”
Each moment’s a chance to rewrite your life’s design.
The horizon calls, and I hear its song,
A melody of hope where I truly belong.

[Chorus]
Infinite horizons, stretching far and wide,
A canvas painted with the colors of the tide.
No matter how far, no matter how long,
The journey’s in my heart, it’s where I belong.

[Bridge]
When the night feels cold and the road runs dry,
Look beyond the fear, let your spirit fly.
There’s a universe within you, vast and untamed,
Every dream you’ve lost is waiting to be reclaimed.

[Outro]
Infinite horizons, they’ll never fade away,
They guide me forward through the darkest day.
With every step, I leave the past behind,
Infinite horizons, they’re forever mine.
