[Intro]
Ooooh...
I can’t escape the way you pull me in
You’re my center, my beginning, my within

[Verse 1]
Every step I take, it leads to you
No matter where I run, I’m drawn right through
Your love’s a force I can’t deny
It lifts me up when I feel like I could die

[Pre-Chorus]
And every time I fall, you catch me in your arms
You’re the calm in my storms, my healing balm
Without you, I’d be lost in the dark

[Chorus]
You’re my gravity, pulling me close
In your orbit, I’ll always slow
I’m weightless when you hold me tight
You’re my stars, my moon, my guiding light
You’re my gravity, and I don’t wanna fight
This feeling, it keeps me alive

[Verse 2]
The world spins fast, but with you, it stops
You make the clock unwind and my heartbeat drop
I’ve searched the skies, but nothing shines
Like the way your love defines all of my signs

[Pre-Chorus]
And every time I fall, you catch me in your arms
You’re the calm in my storms, my healing balm
Without you, I’d be lost in the dark

[Chorus]
You’re my gravity, pulling me close
In your orbit, I’ll always slow
I’m weightless when you hold me tight
You’re my stars, my moon, my guiding light
You’re my gravity, and I don’t wanna fight
This feeling, it keeps me alive

[Bridge]
Ooooh…
If you ever let me go, I’d float away
Lost in space, no place to stay
You’re the anchor that holds me near
Without you, there’s nothing left to hear

[Final Chorus]
You’re my gravity, pulling me close
In your orbit, I’ll always slow
I’m weightless when you hold me tight
You’re my stars, my moon, my guiding light
You’re my gravity, and I don’t wanna fight
This feeling, it keeps me alive

[Outro]
Ooooh…
You’re my gravity…
You keep me alive…
Ohhh…
