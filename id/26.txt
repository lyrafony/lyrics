(Verse 1)
I see you across the room, can't look away
The chemistry's electric, but we can't play
You're the one I crave, but it’s too late
We both know this love, it’s a twisted fate

(Pre-Chorus)
You’re in my mind, you're in my soul
But we’re trapped in a game we can't control
We touch the edge, but we can’t dive in
This passion burns, but it's a deadly sin

(Chorus)
This is forbidden fire, burning inside
Caught in the moment, but we can't hide
I want you close, but I know it’s wrong
Still, I can’t fight it, the pull is too strong
This is forbidden fire, but it feels so right
I lose myself when you’re in my sight
A secret desire, that we can't deny
We’re playing with fire, but we can’t say goodbye

(Verse 2)
Every glance, every touch, it’s like a spark
We hide in the shadows, but we leave a mark
I feel your breath, it’s racing in my chest
But this love is a risk that we can’t confess

(Pre-Chorus)
You’re in my mind, you're in my soul
But we’re trapped in a game we can't control
We touch the edge, but we can’t dive in
This passion burns, but it's a deadly sin

(Chorus)
This is forbidden fire, burning inside
Caught in the moment, but we can't hide
I want you close, but I know it’s wrong
Still, I can’t fight it, the pull is too strong
This is forbidden fire, but it feels so right
I lose myself when you’re in my sight
A secret desire, that we can't deny
We’re playing with fire, but we can’t say goodbye

(Bridge)
I know it’s dangerous, but I can’t resist
Every kiss, every touch, I feel it twist
We’re playing a game with no way out
But I don’t care, I’ll scream and shout

(Chorus - Variation)
This is forbidden fire, burning inside
Caught in the moment, but we can't hide
I want you close, but I know it’s wrong
Still, I can’t fight it, the pull is too strong
This is forbidden fire, but it feels so right
I lose myself when you’re in my sight
A secret desire, that we can't deny
We’re playing with fire, but we can’t say goodbye

(Outro - Soft)
This forbidden fire, this dangerous game
We’ll burn together, but we can’t say your name
In the shadows, we’ll stay and wait
This passion’s forbidden, but it’s our fate
