Verse 1
You said we’re done, so I found someone,
Turns out your best friend’s more fun.
He’s got charm, he’s got style,
And you’re just a shadow in the rearview mile.

Pre-Chorus
I didn’t plan it, but it’s working fine,
Now you’re mad—I’m doing just fine.
Jealousy looks good on you,
But this new love? It fits me too.

Chorus
I dated your friend, yeah, I made my move,
While you were busy overthinking and brooding.
He’s sweeter, he’s kinder, he treats me right,
And now you’re losing sleep every night.
I dated your friend, and it feels so sweet,
Karma’s a mirror—it’s hard to beat.
Sorry, not sorry, this is my game,
Revenge never looked this tame.

Verse 2
We laugh about you, we talk it through,
How you couldn’t see what was right in view.
Now he’s mine, and you’re alone,
Guess this lesson hit you close to home.

Pre-Chorus
You had your chance, but you let me go,
Now I’m shining brighter than you’ll ever know.
Your loss is my win, that’s how it goes,
Sometimes revenge is the sweetest prose.

Chorus
I dated your friend, yeah, I made my move,
While you were busy overthinking and brooding.
He’s sweeter, he’s kinder, he treats me right,
And now you’re losing sleep every night.
I dated your friend, and it feels so sweet,
Karma’s a mirror—it’s hard to beat.
Sorry, not sorry, this is my game,
Revenge never looked this tame.

Bridge
Maybe next time you’ll think twice,
Before you toss away paradise.
Love doesn’t wait, it moves ahead,
And now I’m happy—you’re stuck instead.

Final Chorus (Outro)
I dated your friend, yeah, I made my move,
While you were busy overthinking and brooding.
He’s sweeter, he’s kinder, he treats me right,
And now you’re losing sleep every night.
I dated your friend, and it feels so sweet,
Karma’s a mirror—it’s hard to beat.
Sorry, not sorry, this is my game,
Revenge never looked this tame.

This tame… yeah, revenge is fine.
