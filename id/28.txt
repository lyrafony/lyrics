(Verse 1)
I’ve been through the storm, I've weathered the pain
Fell to the ground, but I’m standing again
The memories, they tried to hold me tight
But I’m breaking free, stepping into the light

(Pre-Chorus)
I won't be held down by what’s been done
The past is gone, and now I’ve won
I’ve found my strength, and it’s shining bright
I'm rising up, no fear in sight

(Chorus)
I’m rising again, I’m finally free
I’m letting go of everything that hurt me
The past can’t hold me, I’ve learned to fly
I’m breaking the chains, reaching for the sky
I’m rising again, I’m finding my way
The past won’t define me, not today
I’ve turned the page, and now I’m alive
I’m rising again, I’m ready to thrive

(Verse 2)
The scars are still there, but they don’t define
Who I am today, I’m no longer blind
I’ll walk my own path, no looking back
I’m stronger now, I’m on the right track

(Pre-Chorus)
I won’t be held down by what’s been done
The past is gone, and now I’ve won
I’ve found my strength, and it’s shining bright
I'm rising up, no fear in sight

(Chorus)
I’m rising again, I’m finally free
I’m letting go of everything that hurt me
The past can’t hold me, I’ve learned to fly
I’m breaking the chains, reaching for the sky
I’m rising again, I’m finding my way
The past won’t define me, not today
I’ve turned the page, and now I’m alive
I’m rising again, I’m ready to thrive

(Bridge)
I’ve made it through the darkest days
And now I’m walking in the light, I’ve found my way
Every step is mine, no one can take it
I’ve faced the storm, and now I’m breaking

(Chorus - Variation)
I’m rising again, I’m finally free
I’m letting go of everything that hurt me
The past can’t hold me, I’ve learned to fly
I’m breaking the chains, reaching for the sky
I’m rising again, I’m finding my way
The past won’t define me, not today
I’ve turned the page, and now I’m alive
I’m rising again, I’m ready to thrive
