[Intro]
I didn’t see it coming, but here I am
Caught in the current of your steady hand

[Verse 1]
At first, it was just a spark, a flicker in the dark
But now it’s blazing bright, lighting up my heart
Your laughter became my favorite song
Every note you sing feels like where I belong

[Pre-Chorus]
And every little thing you do
Paints the sky in shades of blue
I didn’t know love could feel this true

[Chorus]
I’m falling into you, deeper every day
Each moment we share takes my breath away
You’re the sun that rises in my midnight sky
The reason I’m alive, the reason why
I’m falling into you, and I don’t wanna land
In your arms is where I’ll always stand

[Verse 2]
The way you move, the way you speak
Even in silence, your presence speaks
I find myself lost in your design
Every part of you feels so divine

[Pre-Chorus]
And every little thing you do
Paints the sky in shades of blue
I didn’t know love could feel this true

[Chorus]
I’m falling into you, deeper every day
Each moment we share takes my breath away
You’re the sun that rises in my midnight sky
The reason I’m alive, the reason why
I’m falling into you, and I don’t wanna land
In your arms is where I’ll always stand

[Bridge]
There’s no fear when I’m with you
The world fades out, it’s just me and you
Every heartbeat whispers your name
This feeling grows, it’s never the same

[Final Chorus]
I’m falling into you, deeper every day
Each moment we share takes my breath away
You’re the sun that rises in my midnight sky
The reason I’m alive, the reason why
I’m falling into you, and I don’t wanna land
In your arms is where I’ll always stand

[Outro]
Falling into you…
Deeper every day…
I don’t wanna land…
