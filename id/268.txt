[Verse 1]
I walk the line where shadows tread,
Footsteps echo, but no words are said.
Chasing whispers through the empty air,
Dreams that vanish even as I stare.

[Pre-Chorus]
The path is fading, but I still hear,
A distant call pulling me near.

[Chorus]
Ghost tracks leading to nowhere,
Traces of hope in the thin night air.
I follow the sound of a nameless song,
Even if it leads me forever wrong.

[Verse 2]
Each step I take leaves no mark behind,
A fleeting pulse, a rhythm undefined.
The farther I go, the less I see,
But the ghost tracks call—this journey’s me.

[Pre-Chorus]
The path is fading, but I still hear,
A distant call pulling me near.

[Chorus]
Ghost tracks leading to nowhere,
Traces of hope in the thin night air.
I follow the sound of a nameless song,
Even if it leads me forever wrong.

[Bridge]
Through the fog, the echoes grow,
Voices rise where silence flows.
Every shadow hides a clue,
The ghost tracks guide me closer to you.

[Final Chorus]
Ghost tracks glowing in the dark,
Faint reminders of my spark.
I’ll chase the trail though it fades away,
For every step writes what I can’t say.

[Outro]
Beneath the stars, the tracks remain,
Invisible lines through joy and pain.
The ghosts will whisper when I’m gone,
Their echoes live where I belong.
