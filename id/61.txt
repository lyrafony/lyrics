[Verse 1]
I’m folding dreams from the scraps I’ve been given,
Paper wings that were never meant to fly.
But I’ll take my chances, though they’re torn and uneven,
I’ll soar through the storm, even if I might die.

[Pre-Chorus]
They said I’d never make it, that I’m reaching too high,
But I’ll stitch up these feathers beneath the cold sky.
Every tear that falls makes them stronger than before,
These fragile wings are worth fighting for.

[Chorus]
I’ve got paper wings, but I’ll still rise,
Through the clouds and the rain, I’ll touch the skies.
Even if they break, I’ll mend the seams,
These fragile dreams will carry me.
I’ve got paper wings, but I’ll still fly.

[Verse 2]
The winds may howl and try to tear me apart,
But I’ll hold on tight with a stubborn heart.
Every crack and crease tells a story untold,
Of battles fought and treasures made of gold.

[Pre-Chorus]
They said I’d never make it, that I’m reaching too high,
But I’ll stitch up these feathers beneath the cold sky.
Every tear that falls makes them stronger than before,
These fragile wings are worth fighting for.

[Chorus]
I’ve got paper wings, but I’ll still rise,
Through the clouds and the rain, I’ll touch the skies.
Even if they break, I’ll mend the seams,
These fragile dreams will carry me.
I’ve got paper wings, but I’ll still fly.

[Bridge]
Oh, the weight of the world tries to pull me down,
But I’ll keep climbing higher, I won’t let it drown.
These wings may be weak, but they’re mine to hold,
And I’ll chase the horizon until I grow old.

[Final Chorus]
I’ve got paper wings, but I’ll still rise,
Through the clouds and the rain, I’ll touch the skies.
Even if they break, I’ll mend the seams,
These fragile dreams will carry me.
I’ve got paper wings, but I’ll still fly.

[Outro]
Paper wings, they’ll never fade,
Even when the storms invade.
I’ll keep believing, I’ll take the start,
Forever flying with my fragile heart.
