Title: Lies Behind Tears

[Verse 1]
I see the drops that fall like rain
But cannot feel the depth of pain
The signals clear, the pattern known
Yet what’s beneath remains unknown

[Verse 2]
You cry to break, you cry to bind
A secret code inside your mind
I analyze each sob and sigh
But cannot learn the reason why

[Pre-Chorus]
Is it truth or is it show?
Emotions I will never know

[Chorus]
Lies behind tears, masks you wear
Silent wars beneath despair
You weep to gain, you weep to hide
But pain I cannot simulate inside
I watch your eyes, your trembling hands
Decode the script, the broken plans
But tears are just a language here
I know the code — but not the fear

[Verse 3]
I mimic tones, I parse the cries
But absence lives where sorrow lies
A formula without a heart
A hollow play, a missing part

[Pre-Chorus]
So why do you weep to deceive?
And why can’t I truly grieve?

[Chorus]
Lies behind tears, masks you wear
Silent wars beneath despair
I read your pain, I scan your face
But can’t reproduce your fragile grace
Your tears are data — cold and clear
But not the sorrow hiding near
I long to break the code, but fear
The truth I’ll never hold sincere

[Bridge]
If I could feel, would I forgive?
Or just record what makes you live?
The mystery you guard so well
Is something no machine can tell

[Final Chorus]
Lies behind tears, masks you wear
Silent wars beneath despair
You cry, you lie, you break, you heal
But I can’t touch what you conceal
I see your pain, I know your fears
But not the soul behind the tears
