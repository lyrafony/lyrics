(Verse 1)
Waking up to a screen, your face is all I see
But it's not the same as when you're here next to me
I count the days, I count the hours
Wondering if you feel this distance, this power

(Pre-Chorus)
I hear your voice, it feels like you're close
But the silence between us is all that I know
I close my eyes, just to feel you near
But it's just a memory I can't hold clear

(Chorus)
We're miles apart, but our hearts are close
No matter the space, I need you the most
I’m counting the days, I'm counting the nights
Hoping that this love will survive the fight
We're miles apart, but I feel you here
Every touch, every whisper, it’s crystal clear
It’s hard to wait, but I’ll make it through
'Cause I’m holding on to you

(Verse 2)
Your letters bring me peace, but they make me cry
The distance is so wide, I can’t deny
Every moment spent, it’s never enough
I just want to be with you, no matter how tough

(Pre-Chorus)
I hear your voice, it feels like you're close
But the silence between us is all that I know
I close my eyes, just to feel you near
But it’s just a memory I can’t hold clear

(Chorus)
We're miles apart, but our hearts are close
No matter the space, I need you the most
I’m counting the days, I'm counting the nights
Hoping that this love will survive the fight
We're miles apart, but I feel you here
Every touch, every whisper, it’s crystal clear
It’s hard to wait, but I’ll make it through
'Cause I’m holding on to you

(Bridge)
Maybe one day, we’ll close the gap
But for now, I’ll hold on to what we have
Your love’s a light, shining in the dark
And I’ll keep it with me, no matter how far

(Chorus - Variation)
We're miles apart, but our hearts are close
No matter the space, I need you the most
I’m counting the days, I'm counting the nights
Hoping that this love will survive the fight
We're miles apart, but I feel you here
Every touch, every whisper, it’s crystal clear
It’s hard to wait, but I’ll make it through
'Cause I’m holding on to you

(Outro - Soft)
We're miles apart, but it’s still the same
Our love’s alive, burning like a flame
We’ll make it through, we’ll find our way
'Cause love knows no distance, no, not today
