(Verse 1)
Lights go down, but you're still in my mind
Echoes of your voice, stuck on rewind
I see your name, but I don’t call
Holding back, but I feel it all

(Pre-Chorus)
Every song, every street
Brings your ghost right back to me
But I smile, like I’m fine
While my heart is breaking inside

(Chorus)
I’m missing you in silence, hiding all the pain
Drowning in the memories, calling out your name
But you don’t hear, you don’t see
How you're still a part of me
I’m missing you in silence, but you’re already free

(Verse 2)
Scrolling through the pictures, but I look away
Trying to move on, but I'm stuck in yesterday
I fake the laughs, I play the role
But deep inside, I’ve lost control

(Pre-Chorus)
Every song, every street
Brings your ghost right back to me
But I smile, like I’m fine
While my heart is breaking inside

(Chorus)
I’m missing you in silence, hiding all the pain
Drowning in the memories, calling out your name
But you don’t hear, you don’t see
How you're still a part of me
I’m missing you in silence, but you’re already free

(Bridge)
Maybe one day, I’ll forget
Maybe one day, no regrets
But tonight, I’m still here
Whispering words you’ll never hear

(Chorus - Variation)
I’m missing you in silence, hiding all the pain
Drowning in the memories, calling out your name
But you don’t hear, you don’t see
How you're still a part of me
I’m missing you in silence, but you’re already free

(Outro)
So I’ll stay here in the quiet
Loving you in secret, loving you in silence
