[Verse 1]
Beneath the sakura sky,
Petals fall like whispered sighs.
A moment’s bloom, a fleeting grace,
Reflected softly on your face.

[Verse 2]
We walk through clouds of fragile light,
Holding hands in fading bright.
The world around begins to sway,
But in your eyes, I want to stay.

[Chorus]
Like cherry blossoms in the breeze,
Love drifts away with gentle ease.
Though petals fall, our hearts remain,
Bound by the springtime’s tender rain.

[Verse 3]
When shadows stretch and colors fade,
Remember how the blossoms played.
A dance of life, a dance so brief,
Etched in the silence, beyond belief.

[Bridge]
No need to hold, no need to keep,
For love like this is ours to reap.
In every fall, there’s a new rise,
Beneath the sakura skies.

[Outro]
Beneath the sakura sky,
Our memories will never die.
Like petals caught in gentle flight,
Love remains — soft, pure, and light.
