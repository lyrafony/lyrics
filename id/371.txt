[Verse 1]
A roar that shakes the silent skies
Power hidden in gentle eyes
Fierce and calm in perfect blend
A strength that breaks but does not end

[Verse 2]
Claws that guard, a touch that heals
Justice paired with mercy’s seals
Mighty roar and quiet breath
The dance of life, beyond death

[Chorus]
The lion and the lamb reside
In one heart, side by side
Fierce protector, gentle friend
The story that will never end

[Verse 3]
In battles fought without a sound
In mercy’s arms, the lost are found
A paradox of fear and grace
A hidden hope, a sacred place

[Chorus]
The lion and the lamb reside
In one heart, side by side
Fierce protector, gentle friend
The story that will never end

[Bridge]
Strength and softness intertwined
Justice with a heart refined
In silence deep, the truth is told
A love both fierce and bold

[Final Chorus]
The lion and the lamb reside
In one heart, side by side
Fierce protector, gentle friend
The story that will never end
