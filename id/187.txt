[Intro]
I hear the call, it’s pulling me near,
The abyss is waiting, and it’s so clear.
A place so cold, a place so deep,
Where all my nightmares and secrets sleep.

[Verso 1]
I walk the edge, I’m losing my mind,
The abyss calls, and I’m left behind.
It whispers my name, it tells me to fall,
And with every step, I lose it all.

[Pre-Coro]
I’m falling deeper, I can’t turn back,
The darkness consumes me, I’m under attack.
The abyss pulls at my soul, it’s so near,
And now, all I feel is the weight of fear.

[Coro]
Into the abyss, I fall, I dive,
I’m losing myself, but I’m alive.
The darkness swallows, I can’t resist,
I’m falling forever, into the abyss.

[Verso 2]
The echoes of my past, they scream,
But I can’t escape, I can’t redeem.
The abyss has claimed me, I’m its prize,
A prisoner bound by endless lies.

[Puente]
I feel the cold, I feel the pain,
In the abyss, I’ve gone insane.
But still I fall, I’m falling fast,
Into the void, where nothing lasts.

[Coro]
Into the abyss, I fall, I dive,
I’m losing myself, but I’m alive.
The darkness swallows, I can’t resist,
I’m falling forever, into the abyss.
