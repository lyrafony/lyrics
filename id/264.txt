Title: Walls That Speak

[Verse 1]
I hear them whisper when the lights go down,
Voices carved in stone, they′re closing in now.
Every crack and shadow holds their name,
Echoes of a past I couldn′t contain.

[Pre-Chorus]
They built this cell, but not my soul,
Bricks don’t bind me, I’m still whole.

[Chorus]
These walls that speak, they scream your lies,
But I won’t break beneath these skies.
The silence cracks, I’ll rise above,
No chains to hold what burns with love.

[Verse 2]
Their words are daggers dressed as truth,
Etched into the air, they twist my youth.
But every scar becomes a map,
A guide through storms where shadows trap.

[Pre-Chorus]
They built this cage, but not my fire,
Through ash and dust, I climb higher.

[Chorus]
These walls that speak, they scream your lies,
But I won’t break beneath these skies.
The silence cracks, I’ll rise above,
No chains to hold what burns with love.

[Bridge]
Shatter the echoes, let the ruins fall,
I’ll stand alone against it all.
The voice inside is louder now,
It drowns their noise, here’s my vow:

[Final Chorus]
These walls will crumble, turn to dust,
Your hollow threats—they lose their thrust.
I’ll carve my path, no fear remains,
Beyond these walls, true freedom reigns.

[Outro]
So let them talk, let them pretend,
This war is mine—I’ll never bend.
The walls may speak, but I’ll be free,
Their voices fade; they’re nothing to me.
