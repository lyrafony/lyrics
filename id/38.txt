(Verse 1)
Tiny hands wrapped around my finger tight
Eyes so bright, like little stars in the night
I never knew a love so deep, so real
Then you came and made my world stand still

(Pre-Chorus)
Every breath you take, every smile you make
My heart beats just to keep you safe
Through every tear, through every mile
I'll be right here, I'll never hide

(Chorus)
You’re the love of my life, my reason, my light
Every heartbeat sings your name at night
No matter where you go, no matter the time
You'll always be my love, my heart, my sky

(Verse 2)
Your laughter's like a melody so sweet
A lullaby that makes my soul complete
I’ll hold your hand through highs and lows
Through every step, I'll help you grow

(Pre-Chorus)
Every breath you take, every smile you make
My heart beats just to keep you safe
Through every tear, through every mile
I'll be right here, I'll never hide

(Chorus)
You’re the love of my life, my reason, my light
Every heartbeat sings your name at night
No matter where you go, no matter the time
You'll always be my love, my heart, my sky

(Bridge - Soft, Emotional)
When the world feels cold and you lose your way
I’ll be your shelter, I’ll keep you safe
Through every storm, through darkest nights
I’ll be your home, I’ll be your guide

(Chorus - Grand Finale)
You’re the love of my life, my reason, my light
Every heartbeat sings your name at night
No matter where you go, no matter the time
You'll always be my love, my heart, my sky

(Outro - Whispered, Lullaby Feel)
Tiny hands wrapped around my heart so tight
You’re the love of my life, my soul, my light
