[Verse 1]
Bubbles rising in my chest,
Every stepâ€²s a little jest.
Golden laughter fills the air,
Champagne steps, floating where.

[Chorus]
Champagne steps, light and high,
Tapping beats against the sky.
Champagne steps, never fall,
Dancing on a crystal ball.

[Verse 2]
Glistening heels, a toast in hand,
Spinning circles in the sand.
Silky notes beneath our toes,
Champagne steps, and on it goes.

[Chorus]
Champagne steps, light and high,
Tapping beats against the sky.
Champagne steps, never fall,
Dancing on a crystal ball.

[Bridge]
Pop the night, and let it pour,
Sip the rhythm, crave it more.
Raise your feet, the world forgets,
Follow where the champagne sets.

[Chorus]
Champagne steps, light and high,
Tapping beats against the sky.
Champagne steps, never fall,
Dancing on a crystal ball.

[Outro]
Champagne dreams, champagne calls...
Champagne steps through mirrored halls.
