(Verse 1)
I’ve been holding this inside for way too long
Every time you’re near, my heart’s been singing a song
I tried to stay quiet, but I can’t ignore
The way I feel, can’t keep it anymore

(Pre-Chorus)
It’s you I want, you I need
I’m not afraid to finally speak
This love is real, it’s not a game
I’m calling out, will you feel the same?

(Chorus)
I love you, more than words could ever say
I’ve waited for the perfect time, but I can’t wait
I love you, it’s all I’ve ever known
And now it’s time, I want you to be my own
I love you, it’s no secret, it’s true
I’m giving you all of me, it’s just you
I love you, more than you’ll ever see
I’ll shout it loud, you’re everything to me

(Verse 2)
I’ve seen love in movies, but this feels real
A connection so deep, it’s hard to conceal
I want to hold you, to be by your side
Say the words that I’ve been trying to hide

(Pre-Chorus)
It’s you I want, you I need
I’m not afraid to finally speak
This love is real, it’s not a game
I’m calling out, will you feel the same?

(Chorus)
I love you, more than words could ever say
I’ve waited for the perfect time, but I can’t wait
I love you, it’s all I’ve ever known
And now it’s time, I want you to be my own
I love you, it’s no secret, it’s true
I’m giving you all of me, it’s just you
I love you, more than you’ll ever see
I’ll shout it loud, you’re everything to me

(Bridge)
No more hiding, no more doubt
I’m ready to let my love shout out
You’re the one, I can’t deny
I’m giving you my heart, I won’t lie

(Chorus - Variation)
I love you, more than words could ever say
I’ve waited for the perfect time, but I can’t wait
I love you, it’s all I’ve ever known
And now it’s time, I want you to be my own
I love you, it’s no secret, it’s true
I’m giving you all of me, it’s just you
I love you, more than you’ll ever see
I’ll shout it loud, you’re everything to me

(Outro)
I love you, I want you to know
You’re the one, I’ll never let you go
I love you, and I’ll say it again
You’re my everything, now and forever, my friend
