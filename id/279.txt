[Verse 1]
Bite the apple, taste the flame,
A lover’s game, a sinner’s shame.
The sweetness lingers on my tongue,
But the price is high, the stakes unsung.

[Pre-Chorus]
One touch, one taste.
Paradise lost in your embrace.

[Chorus]
Forbidden fruit, it calls my name,
A burning spark, an endless flame.
I’d trade eternity for this sin,
To feel your fire deep within.

[Verse 2]
The garden fades, the skies turn gray,
Yet I’ll choose you every single day.
The world may curse, the heavens fall,
But I’d give it all, I’d give it all.

[Pre-Chorus]
No turning back now.
The die is cast, the vow.

[Chorus]
Forbidden fruit, it calls my name,
A burning spark, an endless flame.
I’d trade eternity for this sin,
To feel your fire deep within.

[Bridge]
They’ll call us reckless, they’ll call us blind,
But this love’s a treasure hard to find.
In the ashes of what we’ve burned,
A new desire has been learned.

[Chorus]
Forbidden fruit, it calls my name,
A burning spark, an endless flame.
I’d trade eternity for this sin,
To feel your fire deep within.

[Outro]
Forbidden fruit, forever sweet,
A love so dark, yet bittersweet.
Even if the world should fade,
This moment’s worth the price we paid.
