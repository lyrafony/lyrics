[Verse 1]
The night is wide, the stars align,
A pulse of light, a fleeting sign.
La la la, it pulls me near,
La la la, no trace of fear.

[Pre-Chorus]
Ri-i-ise, through the haze,
Feel the glow in endless waves.
La la la, let it flow,
La la la, watch it grow.

[Chorus]
We’re dancing slow, we’re fading fast,
Caught between the present and the past.
La la la, feel the sound,
La la la, spinning round.

[Verse 2]
The air is thick, the rhythm calls,
A shadow moves through empty halls.
La la la, it whispers low,
La la la, let it go.

[Pre-Chorus]
Ri-i-ise, through the haze,
Feel the glow in endless waves.
La la la, let it flow,
La la la, watch it grow.

[Chorus]
We’re dancing slow, we’re fading fast,
Caught between the present and the past.
La la la, feel the sound,
La la la, spinning round.

[Bridge]
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh,
Falling through a sea of gold.
La la la, don’t let go,
La la la, feel it show.

[Outro]
Dreamstate rhythm, carry me,
La la la, into the sea.
La la la, fade to white,
La la la, endless night.
