[Verse]
I’ve been walking in circles, lost in the noise,
No more strength, no more fight, no more voice.
They'll question my courage, they'll say I’m weak,
But they don’t know the pain, the tears I keep.

[Verse]
I’ve seen the knives, the cuts in my back,
I gave them all trust, but they took what I lack.
In a world where no one cares for the fall,
Living like there’s no end, no reckoning at all.

[Pre-Chorus]
They run, they climb, they don’t care who they step on,
Fighting for power, for things they can't hold on.
But I'm tired of chasing, of being a pawn,
I’ve made my decision, and I’ll be gone.

[Chorus]
The choice is made, no turning around,
I’ve been broken, and I won’t be found.
They'll call me weak, a fool who won’t fight,
But they don't see the battle inside me tonight.

[Verse]
They live like there’s no end, no price to pay,
But the truth is harsh, and it won't stay away.
I’ve watched them devour, climb on each other,
But when the world falls, they’ll be no different than the others.

[Pre-Chorus]
They run, they climb, they don't see the decay,
Chasing illusions, they’re all just prey.
But I’ve made my choice, my heart’s turned cold,
I’ll leave this world, and watch it unfold.

[Chorus]
The choice is made, no turning around,
I’ve been shattered, but I won't drown.
They'll call me weak, a fool who won’t fight,
But they don't see the battle inside me tonight.

[Verse]
I won’t be a slave to this world anymore,
I’ve walked through fire, I’ve closed every door.
They’ll say I gave up, that I ran from the fight,
But I found peace in the end, in the darkest night.
