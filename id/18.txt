[Verse]
You left without a warning, without a goodbye,
Like I never even mattered in your life.
But I don't feel a thing, not a trace of pain,
Tragedy's been my home, I've learned to stay the same.

[Verse]
You would threaten to leave when I wouldn't play along,
I never expected love, just a list of rights and wrongs.
Pain is something I've known since I was a child,
Don't think I'd break for you—you're not that worthwhile.

[Pre-Chorus]
You're not the first to walk away,
I live for myself, I'll be my own strength every day.

[Chorus]
It doesn't hurt, it doesn't break me, it won't tear me apart,
Just another name in the storm, another fading mark.
It doesn't hurt, it doesn't kill me, just adds to the scars,
Wounds on my skin that will always last.

[Verse]
You're nothing but an echo, a whisper left behind,
A memory that fades, erased by time.
Don't search my eyes for hatred or despair,
My heart learned long ago not to care.

[Verse]
Since I was a child, I knew love wouldn't stay,
People come and go, just passing like the rain.
So I won't blame you, I won't waste a curse,
I'll just keep walking, like I always learned.

[Pre-Chorus]
You're not the first to walk away,
I live for myself, I'll be my own strength every day.

[Chorus]
It doesn't hurt, it doesn't break me, it won't tear me apart,
Just another name in the storm, another fading mark.
It doesn't hurt, it doesn't kill me, just adds to the scars,
Wounds on my skin that will always last.
