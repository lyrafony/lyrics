[Verse 1]
I walked alone through empty streets
With heavy heart and tired feet
No hope to give, no strength to share
Just walls of silence everywhere

[Verse 2]
Then out of nowhere, warm and slow
A touch I never thought would show
Not loud or proud, just soft and sure
A quiet love, simple and pure

[Chorus]
The embrace I didn’t ask for
Caught me when I fell to the floor
No words spoken, no promises made
Just presence that wouldn’t fade
When all was lost, and I was sore
I found the embrace I didn’t ask for

[Verse 3]
I tried to hide, to turn away
But that love wouldn’t let me stray
It held me close, without demand
A refuge made by unseen hands

[Chorus]
The embrace I didn’t ask for
Caught me when I fell to the floor
No words spoken, no promises made
Just presence that wouldn’t fade
When all was lost, and I was sore
I found the embrace I didn’t ask for

[Bridge]
Sometimes the strongest love is still
The one we don’t expect or will
A gentle hand in darkest night
A silent hope that holds us tight

[Final Chorus]
The embrace I didn’t ask for
Caught me when I fell to the floor
No words spoken, no promises made
Just presence that wouldn’t fade
When all was lost, and I was sore
I found the embrace I didn’t ask for
