[Verse 1]
The noise is deafening, but I hear my call,
A burning signal rising through it all.
Your static words can’t hold me down,
I’ll tear the veil and claim my crown.

[Pre-Chorus]
The fire’s lit, the fuse is set,
No more chains, no more regret.

[Chorus]
Burning static, watch it ignite,
Turning darkness into light.
I’ll burn the past, I’ll burn the pain,
From the ashes rises something new again.

[Verse 2]
Your hollow echoes fade to black,
I’m done with shadows holding me back.
Every spark becomes a flame,
A roaring force I can’t contain.

[Pre-Chorus]
The fire’s lit, the fuse is set,
No more chains, no more regret.

[Chorus]
Burning static, watch it ignite,
Turning darkness into light.
I’ll burn the past, I’ll burn the pain,
From the ashes rises something new again.

[Bridge]
Let the inferno cleanse the lies,
Burn the weights that bind my skies.
Every scar becomes a guide,
Through fire’s wrath, I’ll turn and rise.

[Final Chorus]
Burning static, feel the heat,
Breaking free from what we meet.
No more silence, no more fear,
The fire’s alive—it’s burning clear.
