[Intro]
I carry the weight of the things I’ve done,
The sins of my past, the battles I’ve won.
But now I see, I can’t outrun,
The demons I’ve raised, the harm I’ve spun.

[Verso 1]
I let my anger take control,
Left behind a trail of broken souls.
I made my choices, I made my bed,
But the pain still lingers, filling my head.

[Pre-Coro]
Now I stand, and I let them go,
I release my sins, let the wind blow.
All the hatred, all the regret,
I’ll let it fly, I’ll never forget.

[Coro]
Sins to the wind, let them fly,
The burden is gone, and I don’t ask why.
I’ll send them away, to the sky so high,
And hope they’ll be gone when I die.

[Verso 2]
I’ve made my peace, or so I think,
But the wind keeps pulling me to the brink.
My past still haunts, it won’t let go,
But I’ll keep fighting, and let it flow.

[Puente]
The wind will carry all that I’ve done,
The battles, the wars, the hurt I’ve spun.
But I’ll stand tall, I’ll rise above,
And set my soul free, like the wings of a dove.

[Coro]
Sins to the wind, let them fly,
The burden is gone, and I don’t ask why.
I’ll send them away, to the sky so high,
And hope they’ll be gone when I die.
