[Verse 1]
It’s the touch that pulls me in, every time you’re near
The way your body moves, I’m lost in your atmosphere
It’s not love, but it feels just like a fire burning bright
I can’t resist it, I’m hooked on the way you ignite

[Pre-Chorus]
I know we’re not meant to be, but I can’t let it go
The heat between us keeps me coming back for more
You’ve got me tangled in this web, I can’t escape
And even though I know it’s wrong, I crave the taste

[Chorus]
I’m addicted to your skin, I can’t get enough
It’s like a drug, but it’s never love
Every kiss, every touch, every breath we take
I keep coming back, knowing it’s a mistake
I’m addicted to your skin, can’t let you go
Even when I know, I know, it’s not love, no

[Verse 2]
Your skin on mine, a temptation I can’t deny
We’re not in love, but the chemistry feels so high
I’m losing control, I’m falling deep again
But when it’s over, I just want you back again

[Pre-Chorus]
I know we’re not meant to be, but I can’t let it go
The heat between us keeps me coming back for more
You’ve got me tangled in this web, I can’t escape
And even though I know it’s wrong, I crave the taste

[Chorus]
I’m addicted to your skin, I can’t get enough
It’s like a drug, but it’s never love
Every kiss, every touch, every breath we take
I keep coming back, knowing it’s a mistake
I’m addicted to your skin, can’t let you go
Even when I know, I know, it’s not love, no

[Bridge]
We’re tangled in sheets, but we’re both lost
This attraction’s a battle we can’t stop
I keep saying I’ll quit, but you pull me in
And I know that this isn’t where it begins

[Chorus]
I’m addicted to your skin, I can’t get enough
It’s like a drug, but it’s never love
Every kiss, every touch, every breath we take
I keep coming back, knowing it’s a mistake
I’m addicted to your skin, can’t let you go
Even when I know, I know, it’s not love, no

[Outro]
Addicted to your skin, but it’s never love...
I can’t stop, I can’t stop...
It’s not love, no...
