[Verse 1]
I walked through shadows where the light won’t go,
A fragile echo of the man I used to know.
But in the darkness, something stirs alive,
A spark ignites where once I thought I’d die.

[Pre-Chorus]
The ashes whisper secrets in the night,
Promising a dawn beyond the fight.

[Chorus]
From ashes to stars, I’ll rise above,
Carving constellations from the rubble of love.
What once was broken now begins to shine,
A universe reborn within my mind.

[Verse 2]
The weight of endings pressed upon my chest,
But every tear became a seed for what’s next.
Now I gather fragments of who I’ve been,
To build a future vast as galaxies spin.

[Pre-Chorus]
The ashes whisper secrets in the night,
Promising a dawn beyond the fight.

[Chorus]
From ashes to stars, I’ll rise above,
Carving constellations from the rubble of love.
What once was broken now begins to shine,
A universe reborn within my mind.

[Bridge]
Let the fire burn, let the embers glow,
Through every fall, there’s a place to grow.
The sky is endless, it calls my name,
From ashes to stars—I’ll stake my claim.

[Final Chorus]
From ashes to stars, I’ll break the chains,
No longer bound by sorrow or pain.
The scars that marked me are now my guide,
A cosmic journey where dreams collide.

[Outro]
So watch me burn, then watch me soar,
I’m more than ashes, I am something more.
From ashes to stars, I’ll find my way,
A brighter future born of yesterday.
