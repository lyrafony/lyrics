[Verse]
I’m done with the lies, I’m done with the game,
I’m burning the bridges, I’m erasing the shame.
Every word you said, every twisted lie,
I’m watching it all as it burns and dies.

[Chorus]
Burning bridges, watching them fall,
I’ve had enough, I’m done with it all.
No turning back, no regret in sight,
I’ll burn the past and take flight.

[Verse]
You tried to pull me down, you tried to hold me tight,
But I’m breaking free, stepping into the fight.
No more chains, no more ties,
I’ll watch the smoke rise and say my goodbyes.

[Chorus]
Burning bridges, watching them fall,
I’ve had enough, I’m done with it all.
No turning back, no regret in sight,
I’ll burn the past and take flight.

[Bridge]
The flames are high, but I won’t burn,
In the ashes, I will learn.
No more tears, no more pain,
From these ashes, I will reign.

[Chorus]
Burning bridges, watching them fall,
I’ve had enough, I’m done with it all.
No turning back, no regret in sight,
I’ll burn the past and take flight.

[Outro]
Burning bridges, I’m free at last,
From the wreckage, I’m free from the past.
