[Verse]
They cheer, they scream, they curse my name,
Yet I still play the perfect game.
Divide, deceive, I set the stage,
Let them burn with righteous rage.

[Verse]
I raise my fist, I fake a war,
A puppet show behind closed doors.
I demonize, I spread the fear,
Then toast with them and laugh at you here.

[Pre-Chorus]
You think you choose, you think you're free,
But you're just part of my grand deceit.

[Chorus]
Mirrors of colors, I sell them to you,
Shiny lies, you swear they're true.
Enemies by day, but friends at night,
Laughing at your blind devotion.

[Verse]
I feed your hate, I twist the truth,
Make you fight for me, for my abuse.
You swear my name, you hold my flag,
While I count the gold in my hands.

[Pre-Chorus]
You think you choose, you think you're free,
But you're just part of my grand deceit.

[Chorus]
Mirrors of colors, I sell them to you,
Shiny lies, you swear they're true.
Enemies by day, but friends at night,
Laughing at your blind devotion.

[Bridge]
Did you think I’d stand for you?
Did you think my words were true?
When time runs out, you’ll understand,
You’ll be left with empty hands.

[Verse]
The years will pass, the game remains,
A different face, but still the same.
You beg for change, you pray for light,
Yet fall again for crafted lies.

[Verse]
A hollow throne, a broken land,
Built on dreams they stole and damned.
And when you see what’s left behind,
You'll curse the day you bought the lie.
