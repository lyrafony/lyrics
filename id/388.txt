[Verse 1]
Upon the throne of hollow might
Sit shadows veiled from truth and light
Kings of dust, with crowns of rust
Their reign is brief, their word unjust

[Verse 2]
False dominion, fragile lies
Built on sand beneath the skies
Power fades like fleeting breath
A throne that leads to silent death

[Chorus]
Empty thrones, crumbled halls
Echoes lost within the walls
False power, fleeting claim
All will fall beneath the flame

[Verse 3]
The kingdoms rise and kingdoms fall
But one endures beyond them all
A sovereign reign that never bends
Where justice reigns and truth transcends

[Chorus]
Empty thrones, crumbled halls
Echoes lost within the walls
False power, fleeting claim
All will fall beneath the flame

[Bridge]
No mortal crown can stand the test
When faced with truthâ€™s eternal quest
The hollow seat will lose its place
Before the One who holds all grace

[Final Chorus]
Empty thrones, crumbled halls
Echoes lost within the walls
False power, fleeting claim
All will fall beneath the flame
