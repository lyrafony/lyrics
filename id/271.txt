[Intro]
Beyond the edge where the shadows crawl,
A black horizon waits to claim us all.
No map to guide, no stars to steer,
But I’ll face the dark without a tear.

[Verse 1]
The sky is silent, the winds don’t speak,
A void expands where the brave dare seek.
Every step feels heavier than the last,
Yet I move forward—no chains can fasten.

[Pre-Chorus]
The unknown calls, its voice a storm,
But I’ll rise above its endless form.

[Chorus]
Black horizon, swallowing light,
I’ll walk alone into the night.
No fear remains, no bounds to hold,
Through chaos rises strength untold.

[Verse 2]
The ground beneath is brittle and thin,
Each breath I take pulls me further in.
But every shadow fuels my fire,
A spark that grows with each desire.

[Pre-Chorus]
The unknown calls, its voice a storm,
But I’ll rise above its endless form.

[Chorus]
Black horizon, swallowing light,
I’ll walk alone into the night.
No fear remains, no bounds to hold,
Through chaos rises strength untold.

[Bridge]
Let the darkness try to break my will,
It feeds my soul, it always will.
The blackened skies may block the sun,
But I’ll keep fighting till the battle’s won.

[Final Chorus]
Black horizon, endless and wide,
I’ll carve my path through the tide.
No chains remain, no walls confine,
From ashes rises a brighter sign.
