[Verse 1]
Beyond the masks and hollow praise
A quiet voice begins to raise
A heart sincere, a soul laid bare
Seeking truth beyond the glare

[Verse 2]
No longer bound by false pretence
Breaking chains of cold offence
With open hands and open eyes
Embracing light beyond disguise

[Chorus]
True heart beats, steady and strong
Guiding where we all belong
Not just words, but deeds impart
Living with a true heart

[Verse 3]
In humble acts and kindness shown
The seeds of grace are truly sown
A faith that breathes, a love that grows
In truth and light, the spirit knows

[Chorus]
True heart beats, steady and strong
Guiding where we all belong
Not just words, but deeds impart
Living with a true heart

[Bridge]
Let pride dissolve, let mercy lead
In every step, in every deed
From shadows deep to light anew
A life redeemed, a soul made true

[Final Chorus]
True heart beats, steady and strong
Guiding where we all belong
Not just words, but deeds impart
Living with a true heart
