[Verse 1]
The sun is rising, it’s a brand new day,
The island’s calling, let’s drift away,
The ocean whispers, and we start to sway,
Feel the island breeze, come what may.

[Chorus]
Island breeze, so fresh and free,
A peaceful place where we can just be,
With the waves rolling, we’re wild and free,
Island breeze, just you and me.

[Verse 2]
Palm trees swaying, the world’s so bright,
We walk barefoot in the soft sunlight,
No worries here, everything feels right,
In this paradise, we take flight.

[Chorus]
Island breeze, so fresh and free,
A peaceful place where we can just be,
With the waves rolling, we’re wild and free,
Island breeze, just you and me.

[Bridge]
The world can wait, we’ve found our place,
In the island breeze, we find our grace,
No need to rush, just embrace the space,
In this calm, we’re setting the pace.

[Chorus]
Island breeze, so fresh and free,
A peaceful place where we can just be,
With the waves rolling, we’re wild and free,
Island breeze, just you and me.

[Outro]
Island breeze, it’s all we need,
In the warmth of the sun, we’re planted like a seed,
Island breeze, together we’ll succeed,
We’ll keep it simple, it’s all we need.
