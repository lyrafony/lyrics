--

[Verse 1]
The sky grows dark, a distant fire
Whispers ride on winds of ire
Silent drums begin to beat
Shadows move along the street

[Verse 2]
Promises sold in gilded halls
Where echoes hide behind the walls
Greed unfolds its quiet claim
While hope is caught inside the flame

[Chorus]
Smoke on the horizon, rising high
Veiling truth behind the sky
The world holds breath, unsure, confined
Waiting for the unseen sign

[Verse 3]
Voices rise in hidden schemes
Breaking fragile, shattered dreams
Yet in the midst of smoke and war
A light remains forevermore

[Chorus]
Smoke on the horizon, rising high
Veiling truth behind the sky
The world holds breath, unsure, confined
Waiting for the unseen sign

[Bridge]
Though darkness spreads and fears collide
There’s strength beyond the turning tide
A quiet force that will not fade
The hope that’s born when light invades

[Final Chorus]
Smoke on the horizon, rising high
Veiling truth behind the sky
The world holds breath, unsure, confined
Waiting for the unseen sign
