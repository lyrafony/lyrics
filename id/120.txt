[Verse 1]
Midnight calls, the engine roars,
feet on the gas, we’re out the door.
City lights fade in the rearview,
just me and you, nothing to lose.

[Pre-Chorus]
Wind in our hair, fire in our veins,
running so fast, we forget the pain.
No more chains, no more lies,
we’re chasing freedom tonight.

[Chorus]
We are runaway hearts, wild and free,
breaking the rules, just you and me.
No looking back, no slowing down,
we own the night, we own this town!

[Verse 2]
No one knows where we belong,
but side by side, we’re never wrong.
Every road leads to the unknown,
but with you, I’m already home.

[Pre-Chorus]
Wind in our hair, fire in our veins,
running so fast, we forget the pain.
No more chains, no more lies,
we’re chasing freedom tonight.

[Chorus]
We are runaway hearts, wild and free,
breaking the rules, just you and me.
No looking back, no slowing down,
we own the night, we own this town!

[Bridge]
Even if the road gets rough,
even when the nights get tough,
I know we’ll never be apart,
we’ll keep running, runaway hearts!

[Final Chorus]
We are runaway hearts, wild and free,
breaking the rules, just you and me.
No looking back, no slowing down,
we own the night, we own this town!
