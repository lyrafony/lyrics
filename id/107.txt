[Verse 1]
Beneath the neon glow, I feel it all again,
The weight we carry, the scars beneath our skin.
Every step we take, it pulls us to the ground,
But still, we rise, though the chains make no sound.

Memories linger like shadows in the rain,
Stories of loss, of joy, of quiet pain.
We hold them close, though they break our stride,
The weight we carry is where our strength resides.

[Chorus]
The weight we carry, it bends but won’t break,
A testament to the battles we’ve fought, the paths we’ve made.
Though it slows us down, it shapes who we are,
The weight we carry leaves its mark.

[Verse 2]
Through endless nights, I’ve felt its crushing hold,
But in the darkness, I found a strength untold.
The weight reminds me of how far I’ve come,
Of every mountain climbed, of every war won.

It’s not the burden, but the lessons we learn,
The bridges we build when the fires burn.
We carry the past, but it doesn’t define,
We’re more than the weight; we’re crossing the line.

[Chorus]
The weight we carry, it bends but won’t break,
A testament to the battles we’ve fought, the paths we’ve made.
Though it slows us down, it shapes who we are,
The weight we carry leaves its mark.

[Bridge]
When the load feels heavy, and the road runs thin,
Remember the light that lives deep within.
The weight is proof you’re still standing tall,
It’s not the end—it’s part of it all.

[Outro]
The weight we carry, it’s ours to hold,
A story of courage, of hearts so bold.
Though it bends us low, it lifts us high,
The weight we carry helps us fly.
