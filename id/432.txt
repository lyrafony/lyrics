--

[Verse 1]
The night recedes, the shadows fall
A whispered hope outshines them all
The scales will tip, the truth be known
A dawn where justice claims its throne

[Verse 2]
No more silence, no more chains
The broken rise, break free of pains
A world reborn from ash and dust
Where truth and mercy reign in trust

[Chorus]
Justice’s dawn, the morning light
Breaking through the darkest night
Though trials come and powers sway
Hope endures, the rightful way

[Verse 3]
The tyrants fall, their reign is done
The battle lost, the victory won
A steady hand, a heart made strong
Guides the way where we belong

[Chorus]
Justice’s dawn, the morning light
Breaking through the darkest night
Though trials come and powers sway
Hope endures, the rightful way

[Bridge]
In every heart a seed is sown
A promise kept, a truth made known
And through the storm, the light will shine
Justice’s dawn, a hope divine

[Final Chorus]
Justice’s dawn, the morning light
Breaking through the darkest night
Though trials come and powers sway
Hope endures, the rightful way
