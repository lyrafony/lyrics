[Verse 1]
Pulse of fire in the air,
Golden beat, beyond compare.
Snap of fingers, claps of light,
Moving bodies through the night.

[Chorus]
Golden beat, take my soul,
Wrap me up and lose control.
Golden beat, loud and sweet,
Lift me higher off my feet.

[Verse 2]
Bassline dripping, smooth and slow,
Tangled steps that overflow.
Liquid gold inside my chest,
Golden beat, you know me best.

[Chorus]
Golden beat, take my soul,
Wrap me up and lose control.
Golden beat, loud and sweet,
Lift me higher off my feet.

[Bridge]
Every shimmer, every sway,
Golden beat wonâ€²t fade away.
In this fever, in this heat,
We surrender to the beat.

[Chorus]
Golden beat, take my soul,
Wrap me up and lose control.
Golden beat, loud and sweet,
Lift me higher off my feet.

[Outro]
Golden beat... never retreat...
