[Intro]
Feel the heat rising…
Let’s go…

[Verse 1]
Your touch ignites a flame I can’t contain
Every move you make drives me insane
I feel it burning, deep in my veins
This fire between us, impossible to tame

You’re a spark in the dark, lighting up my soul
No words needed when your body takes control
The rhythm pulls us closer, we’re losing track of time
This chemistry’s electric, a collision so divine

[Pre-Chorus]
It’s getting hotter, can’t you feel it?
Our bodies moving, no way to conceal it
We’re crossing lines, no turning back
This fire’s consuming, it’s an endless attack

[Chorus]
Fuego en la piel, burning through my veins
Every touch is fire, driving me insane
Can’t escape this heat, it’s everywhere I go
You’re the spark that lights the glow
Fuego en la piel, feel it take control
This passion’s endless, it’s taking its toll
Together we burn, brighter than the sun
Baby, this fire’s never done

[Verse 2]
The night is young, but the flames are high
Your gaze alone could set the sky on fire
We’re dancing in the shadows, no rules to obey
This moment’s ours, let’s let it stay

Your hands on mine, they tell a story untold
A blaze of passion, fierce and bold
No fear, no shame, just pure desire
We’re fueling this fire, taking it higher

[Pre-Chorus]
It’s getting hotter, can’t you feel it?
Our bodies moving, no way to conceal it
We’re crossing lines, no turning back
This fire’s consuming, it’s an endless attack

[Chorus]
Fuego en la piel, burning through my veins
Every touch is fire, driving me insane
Can’t escape this heat, it’s everywhere I go
You’re the spark that lights the glow
Fuego en la piel, feel it take control
This passion’s endless, it’s taking its toll
Together we burn, brighter than the sun
Baby, this fire’s never done

[Bridge]
Ooooh…
Feel the flames, they’re taking over
We’re lost in this heat, nothing can stop us
No limits here, just you and me
This fire’s eternal, our destiny

[Final Chorus]
Fuego en la piel, burning through my veins
Every touch is fire, driving me insane
Can’t escape this heat, it’s everywhere I go
You’re the spark that lights the glow
Fuego en la piel, feel it take control
This passion’s endless, it’s taking its toll
Together we burn, brighter than the sun
Baby, this fire’s never done

[Outro]
Fuego en la piel…
Feel it burn…
