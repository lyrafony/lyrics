[Intro]
Ohhh… ohhh…
We’re chasing something we can’t hold…
Ohhh… ohhh…
A story written in the folds…

[Verse 1]
The rhythm breaks, the night unfolds,
A pulse of light within the cold.
No chains to bind, no fear to stay,
This is where the wild ones play.

[Pre-Chorus]
Higher, higher, feel it rise…
Burning through the midnight skies…

[Chorus]
Chasing infinity, we’ll never stop,
Every heartbeat fuels the drop.
Through the echoes, through the sound,
We’ll keep on running, never found.

[Verse 2]
The ground dissolves, we’re weightless now,
A spark ignites, a sacred vow.
No past, no future, only here,
The music pulls us far and near.

[Pre-Chorus]
Higher, higher, feel it rise…
Burning through the midnight skies…

[Chorus]
Chasing infinity, we’ll never stop,
Every heartbeat fuels the drop.
Through the echoes, through the sound,
We’ll keep on running, never found.

[Bridge]
Ohhh… ohhh…
Lost in motion, lost in time…
Ohhh… ohhh…
Breaking free from the climb…

[Outro]
Infinity calls, we answer loud,
Dancing through the endless crowd.
Ohhh… ohhh…
Forever chasing, forever proud…
