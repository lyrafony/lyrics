[Verse 1]
I’ve carried guilt like a stone in my chest,
A heavy burden I couldn’t digest.
Every mistake plays on repeat,
Haunting my mind, stealing my peace.
The mirror reflects a face I don’t know,
Worn down by shame, by the weight of “what if.”
But forgiveness calls through the cracks in my soul,
A fragile thread stitching me whole.

[Pre-Chorus]
It’s hard to let go when the past won’t fade,
When every misstep feels like it’s paid.
But holding on tight only chains your heart,
Freedom begins when you choose to restart.

[Chorus]
I’ll forgive myself for the wrongs I’ve done,
For the battles lost, for the damage begun.
Every stumble shaped who I am today,
And grace is the light that will show me the way.
With every tear, I’ll release the pain,
Let mercy wash away the stain.
This is my healing, my chance to be free,
To love the person I’m learning to see.

[Verse 2]
I’ve punished myself with memories untold,
Rewriting stories where I’m always at fault.
But growth isn’t perfect; it’s messy and raw,
A winding road teaching us how to draw.
Each scar reminds me I’m still alive,
That even broken hearts can revive.
So I’ll lay down the guilt, let the shadows fall,
And rise as someone stronger than them all.

[Pre-Chorus]
It’s hard to let go when the past won’t fade,
When every misstep feels like it’s paid.
But holding on tight only chains your heart,
Freedom begins when you choose to restart.

[Chorus]
I’ll forgive myself for the wrongs I’ve done,
For the battles lost, for the damage begun.
Every stumble shaped who I am today,
And grace is the light that will show me the way.
With every tear, I’ll release the pain,
Let mercy wash away the stain.
This is my healing, my chance to be free,
To love the person I’m learning to see.
