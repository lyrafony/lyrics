[Intro]
I see forever when I look at you
A galaxy of promises, every one true

[Verse 1]
In your gaze, I find my peace
Every storm that rages just comes to cease
Your eyes are windows to a world so vast
Where I’m safe, and the shadows pass

[Pre-Chorus]
They tell me stories words can’t say
A thousand dreams within their sway
No need for maps, no need for signs
I’ve found it all—your universe shines

[Chorus]
There’s a universe in your eyes
Where I’m weightless, where love never dies
Every star is a promise we made
In your arms, I’m unafraid
There’s a universe in your eyes
And I’ll get lost if I have to decide

[Verse 2]
The way they shimmer, the way they glow
Even in silence, they always show
The depth of your soul, the truth you keep
In your eyes, I’ve found my sleep

[Pre-Chorus]
They tell me stories words can’t say
A thousand dreams within their sway
No need for maps, no need for signs
I’ve found it all—your universe shines

[Chorus]
There’s a universe in your eyes
Where I’m weightless, where love never dies
Every star is a promise we made
In your arms, I’m unafraid
There’s a universe in your eyes
And I’ll get lost if I have to decide

[Bridge]
When the world feels cold and I lose my way
I’ll look at you, and night turns to day
You’re my compass, my guiding light
In your eyes, everything feels right

[Final Chorus]
There’s a universe in your eyes
Where I’m weightless, where love never dies
Every star is a promise we made
In your arms, I’m unafraid
There’s a universe in your eyes
And I’ll get lost if I have to decide

[Outro]
Universe in your eyes…
I’ll stay here till the stars collide…
