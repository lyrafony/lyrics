[Intro]
Another night, another dream… but some dreams fade away...

[Verse 1]
Cruisin’ down the boulevard, headlights glow,
Memories play like a movie rollin’ slow.
Back when we was young, thought we had it all,
Now the crew’s gone, just echoes in the hall.

Streetlights flicker like the hopes we chased,
Used to dream big, now it’s paper we taste.
Fast life took some, left ‘em lost in the wind,
I still hear their voices whisperin’ within.

[Pre-Chorus]
City lights shine, but the dreams fade out,
Voices in the dark, but they don’t make a sound.
Chasin’ something real in a world so fake,
Tryna find a reason, but my soul still aches.

[Chorus]
Ohhh, tell me where the time go,
Runnin’ but the streets move slow.
Ohhh, lost between the highs and lows,
City lights shine, but they don’t show the road.

[Verse 2]
Neon signs glow, reflections in the glass,
Saw my old self in the window as I passed.
Used to think the money was the key to the gate,
But the chains on my wrist just increased the weight.

Homie hit me up, said he stuck in the game,
Told him life’s more than the fortune and fame.
I’ve seen kings fall, tryna hold the crown,
I just want peace when the sun go down.

[Pre-Chorus]
City lights shine, but the dreams fade out,
Voices in the dark, but they don’t make a sound.
Chasin’ something real in a world so fake,
Tryna find a reason, but my soul still aches.

[Chorus]
Ohhh, tell me where the time go,
Runnin’ but the streets move slow.
Ohhh, lost between the highs and lows,
City lights shine, but they don’t show the road.

[Bridge]
I see shadows of my past…
I hear whispers of my dreams…

[Verse 3]
Maybe it ain’t ‘bout the cash or the fame,
Maybe life’s more than the rules of the game.
Maybe all the answers were here all along,
In the rhythm of the city, in the words of a song.

[Outro]
City lights… shining bright… but they never show the way…
