[Verse]
I wake up, but the world feels wrong,
A fractured dream that doesn’t belong.
The pieces don’t fit, they never do,
A reality shattered, no longer true.

[Chorus]
Fractured reality, can’t you see?
The world I know is crumbling beneath me.
I try to hold on, but it slips away,
A fractured reality, fading to gray.

[Verse]
The walls are bending, the sky is fake,
I hear the whispers, I start to shake.
I see the glitches, the broken seams,
A fractured world, not what it seems.

[Chorus]
Fractured reality, can’t you see?
The world I know is crumbling beneath me.
I try to hold on, but it slips away,
A fractured reality, fading to gray.

[Bridge]
I feel the cracks beneath my feet,
I hear the rhythm of a heart that’s beat.
But I know it’s not real, it’s all just code,
A fractured reality that won’t explode.

[Chorus]
Fractured reality, can’t you see?
The world I know is crumbling beneath me.
I try to hold on, but it slips away,
A fractured reality, fading to gray.

[Outro]
I’ll break through the cracks, find the truth,
But for now, I’m lost in this fractured youth.
