[Verse 1]
Through boundless realms where ages turn
Eternal sounds begin to burn
A timeless voice that weaves and winds
The endless song the spirit finds

[Verse 2]
No mortal chains can bind or hold
The sacred sound, the truth retold
From ancient depths to skies unknown
The infiniteâ€™s soft undertone

[Chorus]
Reverberations vast and wide
Resounding deep where souls abide
A sacred call beyond the night
Guiding hearts to endless light

[Verse 3]
In every heart, the murmurs play
A glimpse of dawn, a breaking day
The boundless truth that will not cease
A melody of perfect peace

[Chorus]
Reverberations vast and wide
Resounding deep where souls abide
A sacred call beyond the night
Guiding hearts to endless light

[Bridge]
Through time and space, the voices soar
A timeless dance forevermore
With holy strength and endless grace
They lead us to the sacred place

[Final Chorus]
Reverberations vast and wide
Resounding deep where souls abide
A sacred call beyond the night
Guiding hearts to endless light
