[Verse 1]
Words like honey, sweet and cold
Selling tales that leave souls sold
Promises forged on shifting sand
Deception’s mark upon the land

[Verse 2]
Behind the smile, a hidden snare
False prophets prey on those who care
Counting coins while prayers arise
Empty hearts and hollow lies

[Chorus]
False prophets’ song, a siren’s call
Leading many to their fall
Masked in truth, cloaked in greed
Voices born to mislead

[Verse 3]
But justice waits beyond the veil
A reckoning none can derail
The truth will shine, the mask will fall
And falsehoods face their final call

[Chorus]
False prophets’ song, a siren’s call
Leading many to their fall
Masked in truth, cloaked in greed
Voices born to mislead

[Bridge]
Hear the cries of broken trust
Raise the voice against the unjust
Stand for truth, let lies be gone
Drown the false prophets’ song

[Final Chorus]
False prophets’ song, a siren’s call
Leading many to their fall
Masked in truth, cloaked in greed
Voices born to mislead
