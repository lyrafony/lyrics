Verse 1
You played me once, you played me twice,
Now it’s my turn to roll the dice.
I’ll fade away, I’ll disappear,
Watch you panic when I’m not here.

Pre-Chorus
I won’t text back, I won’t reply,
Let you wonder why, let you ask why.
Three dots will haunt your mind at night,
Karma’s sweet when you’re out of sight.

Chorus
This is the ghosting anthem,
Catchy as it gets, I’m done with them.
No more calls, no more lies,
I’ll leave you guessing till the sunrise.
This is the ghosting anthem,
Turn the tables, now you’re the problem.
Feel the silence, feel the sting,
Welcome to my disappearing ring.

Verse 2
I blocked your number, deleted your face,
Erased your name from every space.
You thought you’d win, but now you’re stuck,
With unanswered texts and bad luck.

Pre-Chorus
I don’t owe you, I don’t care,
You had your chance, but you weren’t fair.
Now you’re chasing shadows in the dark,
And I’m lighting up like a spark.

Chorus
This is the ghosting anthem,
Catchy as it gets, I’m done with them.
No more calls, no more lies,
I’ll leave you guessing till the sunrise.
This is the ghosting anthem,
Turn the tables, now you’re the problem.
Feel the silence, feel the sting,
Welcome to my disappearing ring.

Bridge
Maybe one day you’ll understand,
Why I slipped right out of your hand.
Ghosting’s easy, ghosting’s clean,
Sometimes silence is the best revenge.

Final Chorus (Outro)
This is the ghosting anthem,
Catchy as it gets, I’m done with them.
No more calls, no more lies,
I’ll leave you guessing till the sunrise.
This is the ghosting anthem,
Turn the tables, now you’re the problem.
Feel the silence, feel the sting,
Welcome to my disappearing ring.
