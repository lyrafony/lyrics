[Verse 1]
I saw you dancing in the moonlight glow,
Your smile was like a fire, burning oh so slow.
The rhythm of the night took hold of us,
In that moment, I knew, my heart was yours to trust.

[Pre-Chorus]
Every step we take feels like destiny,
Underneath the stars, it′s you and me.

[Chorus]
You sang to me, your voice was like a melody,
A song of love that set my soul free.
In your arms, I found my home,
With every word, my heart you’ve shown.
You sang to me, and now I’m lost in harmony.

[Verse 2]
The world could fade away, I wouldn’t even care,
As long as you are near, the music fills the air.
Each note you whispered felt like a dream,
Together we can make this magic stream.

[Pre-Chorus]
Every beat we share feels like eternity,
Underneath the sky, it’s you and me.

[Chorus]
You sang to me, your voice was like a melody,
A song of love that set my soul free.
In your arms, I found my home,
With every word, my heart you’ve shown.
You sang to me, and now I’m lost in harmony.

[Bridge]
Oh, the rhythm keeps on playing,
Our hearts are here, forever swaying.
No words could ever truly say,
How much I need you every day.

[Chorus]
You sang to me, your voice was like a melody,
A song of love that set my soul free.
In your arms, I found my home,
With every word, my heart you’ve shown.
You sang to me, and now I’m lost in harmony.

[Outro]
You sang to me…
Now I’ll sing to you endlessly.
