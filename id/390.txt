[Verse 1]
Bound by chains no eyes can see
Tied to shadows, never free
Idols carved from shifting dust
Crushing hope, betraying trust

[Verse 2]
Fingers grasp at hollow air
Promises false, beyond repair
Caught within a web of lies
Lost beneath the empty skies

[Chorus]
Chains of dust, heavy and cold
Burdens carried, stories told
Breaking free is hard to trust
When bound by chains made out of dust

[Verse 3]
But whispers call beyond the cage
A voice of truth, beyond the rage
A path to light, a way to rise
Breaking chains that bind and blind

[Chorus]
Chains of dust, heavy and cold
Burdens carried, stories told
Breaking free is hard to trust
When bound by chains made out of dust

[Bridge]
No idol’s weight can hold the soul
When freed by grace and made whole
The dust will fall, the chains will break
And new life rise for freedom’s sake

[Final Chorus]
Chains of dust, heavy and cold
Burdens carried, stories told
Breaking free is hard to trust
When bound by chains made out of dust
