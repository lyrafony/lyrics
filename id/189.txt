[Intro]
The darkness calls, it pulls me in,
I feel the weight of everything I’ve sinned.
My past a ghost, my future a blur,
In the shadows, I’m trapped, I stir.

[Verso 1]
I see the faces, I hear the screams,
Shadows of my past, haunting my dreams.
I can’t escape, I can’t break free,
The shadows are my prison, swallowing me.

[Pre-Coro]
The rage, the pain, the hurt inside,
It’s tearing me apart, there’s nowhere to hide.
I search for light, I search for peace,
But the shadows hold me, they never cease.

[Coro]
Torn by shadows, lost in the dark,
The light I seek is just a spark.
I fight the demons that I’ve become,
But in these shadows, I’m undone.

[Verso 2]
Every step I take, they pull me back,
The weight of my guilt, the fear I lack.
I want to escape, I want to break,
But the shadows keep me awake.

[Puente]
I’m torn apart by the ghosts of my past,
Each mistake, each regret, it’s built to last.
But I’ll fight, I’ll stand my ground,
And one day, I’ll tear these shadows down.

[Coro]
Torn by shadows, lost in the dark,
The light I seek is just a spark.
I fight the demons that I’ve become,
But in these shadows, I’m undone.
