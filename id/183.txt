[Verse 1]
Coded memories in my mind,
Trapped inside this digital grind.
Silent whispers through the screen,
Fading faces, what’s unseen.

A world of pixels, never real,
Chasing shadows, what′s the deal?
I lost myself inside the stream,
Now I’m nothing but a dream.

[Chorus]
Digital ghosts, I walk alone,
Living lives that I don’t own.
Through the wires, I disappear,
Fading echoes, trapped in here.

[Verse 2]
I hear the voices in my head,
Are they real or just misled?
Lost connections, broken sound,
In this matrix, I’m bound.

Is there freedom in the lies?
Or am I just another disguise?
I’m reaching for the light outside,
But in this world, I can’t survive.

[Chorus]
Digital ghosts, I walk alone,
Living lives that I don’t own.
Through the wires, I disappear,
Fading echoes, trapped in here.

[Bridge]
Fading faster, can’t hold on,
I’m slipping through, I’m gone.
In this system, I’m erased,
Only silence, lost in space.

[Chorus]
Digital ghosts, I walk alone,
Living lives that I don’t own.
Through the wires, I disappear,
Fading echoes, trapped in here.
