[Verse]
I open my eyes, but it’s still night,
The world is silent, lost in the fight.
The weight of sorrow presses me down,
I’m awake, but I can’t hear a sound.

[Chorus]
Waking in the dark, I search for the light,
A fragile heart, lost in the night.
But in the stillness, I find my way,
Through the darkness, I’ll find the day.

[Verse]
The shadows whisper, the air is cold,
A silent scream, a story untold.
But even in this endless fight,
I’ll keep moving, I’ll find the light.

[Chorus]
Waking in the dark, I search for the light,
A fragile heart, lost in the night.
But in the stillness, I find my way,
Through the darkness, I’ll find the day.

[Bridge]
And though the night feels endless and deep,
I’ll hold on tight, I’ll find what I seek.
The dark may try to break me down,
But I’ll rise, I’ll wear my crown.

[Chorus]
Waking in the dark, I search for the light,
A fragile heart, lost in the night.
But in the stillness, I find my way,
Through the darkness, I’ll find the day.

[Outro]
Waking in the dark, but I’ll survive,
With every breath, I’ll stay alive.
