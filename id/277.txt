[Verse 1]
Neon lights blur the lines of truth,
Is this love or just a fleeting youth?
In the haze, I lose control,
Dancing with a midnight soul.

[Pre-Chorus]
Your eyes reflect the city glow,
A world where only shadows know.
We’re chasing dreams that fade too fast,
Caught between the present and the past.

[Chorus]
Midnight mirage, you haunt my mind,
A phantom love I can’t define.
Under electric skies we fall,
But in the morning, there’s nothing at all.

[Verse 2]
The streets are cold, but your touch is fire,
Pulling me deeper into desire.
Every step feels like a lie,
Yet I can’t resist your hypnotic eye.

[Pre-Chorus]
Your voice fades like a distant song,
But I follow though it feels so wrong.
This illusion burns so bright,
I’m lost within its velvet night.

[Chorus]
Midnight mirage, you haunt my mind,
A phantom love I can’t define.
Under electric skies we fall,
But in the morning, there’s nothing at all.

[Bridge]
Is this real, or just a dream?
You’re the shadow, I’m the beam.
In the chaos, we find our place,
A fleeting moment, a stolen grace.

[Chorus]
Midnight mirage, you haunt my mind,
A phantom love I can’t define.
Under electric skies we fall,
But in the morning, there’s nothing at all.

[Outro]
Midnight mirage, you disappear,
Leaving whispers I hold near.
In the silence, I still see,
The ghost of you who loved me.
