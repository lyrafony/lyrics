[Verse 1]
In shadows deep, where falsehoods creep
A steady flame begins to leap
Breaking through the darkest veil
A light that will not fail

[Verse 2]
Beyond the noise, beyond the lies
A radiant truth forever flies
Calling hearts to rise and see
The path to what is free

[Chorus]
True light shines, pure and strong
Guiding souls where they belong
In every heart, a spark ignites
Leading on through endless nights

[Verse 3]
No chains can hold, no dark confine
The power of this light divine
It heals the broken, frees the lost
At every cost, it pays the cost

[Chorus]
True light shines, pure and strong
Guiding souls where they belong
In every heart, a spark ignites
Leading on through endless nights

[Bridge]
Stand firm in truth, refuse to stray
Let false idols fade away
With eyes fixed on the eternal sight
Walk boldly in the true light

[Final Chorus]
True light shines, pure and strong
Guiding souls where they belong
In every heart, a spark ignites
Leading on through endless nights
