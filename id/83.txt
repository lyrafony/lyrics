[Verse 1]
I stand at the edge where the unknown calls,
a precipice wide where the future stalls.
Each step feels like falling, yet I rise,
chasing the dawn through shadowed skies.

[Pre-Chorus]
The fear is loud, but hope burns bright,
guiding me forward through endless night.

[Chorus]
On the edge of becoming, I find my way,
shaping tomorrow from yesterday.
Though the path bends and the winds collide,
I’ll walk this line where dreams reside.

[Verse 2]
The echoes of doubt try to pull me back,
but every heartbeat charts my track.
The weight of the world can’t hold me down,
I’ll build my wings as I leave the ground.

[Bridge]
Every fall teaches me to soar,
every wound opens a hidden door.
The edge isn’t ending—it’s just begun,
a canvas waiting for the rising sun.

[Final Section]
On the edge of becoming, I find my way,
shaping tomorrow from yesterday.
Though the path bends and the winds collide,
I’ll walk this line where dreams reside.
