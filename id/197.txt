[Intro]
Circling above, they smell the blood,
Waiting for the fall, they come from the mud.
Predators lurking, the end is near,
But I won’t go down, I won’t show fear.

[Verso 1]
They watch me struggle, they watch me fight,
Hoping I′ll crumble, hoping I’ll die tonight.
But I see their shadows, I know their game,
They’ll never break me, I’ll make them pay.

[Pre-Coro]
Like vultures in the sky, they wait for me to break,
But they’ll never taste the blood they crave.
I’ll rise from the ashes, I’ll fight till the end,
You’ll never get the satisfaction you intend.

[Coro]
Vultures in the sky, waiting for my fall,
But they’ll never hear my scream, they’ll never see me crawl.
I’ll stand tall, I’ll take the pain,
And when I rise, they’ll be the ones to feel the strain.

[Verso 2]
They feed on weakness, they feed on despair,
But I’ve built my strength, now I’m fully prepared.
I won’t let them win, I won’t let them take,
What’s mine to hold, no matter the stake.

[Puente]
The vultures circle, but I stand my ground,
They’ll never get me, not while I’m unbound.
The sky is theirs, but the ground is mine,
And when I rise, they’ll be left behind.

[Coro]
Vultures in the sky, waiting for my fall,
But they’ll never hear my scream, they’ll never see me crawl.
I’ll stand tall, I’ll take the pain,
And when I rise, they’ll be the ones to feel the strain.
