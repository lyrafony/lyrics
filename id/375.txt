[Verse 1]
Shadows stretch across my soul
A silence deep I can′t control
The weight of all I′ve lost and failed
A heart that’s bruised, a spirit veiled

[Verse 2]
No stars to guide, no light to find
Just emptiness that clouds my mind
The night is long, the cold runs deep
In darkness, secrets safely keep

[Chorus]
This darkest night, it tests my breath
A silent war, a dance with death
Yet in the black, a flicker grows
A whispered hope that no one knows

[Verse 3]
Though broken bones may ache and strain
And tears may fall like gentle rain
The dawn will come, its light will bleed
And from the dark, new life will seed

[Chorus]
This darkest night, it tests my breath
A silent war, a dance with death
Yet in the black, a flicker grows
A whispered hope that no one knows

[Bridge]
Hold fast, hold on, the night won’t last
The storm will fade, the shadow cast
And through the pain, the soul will rise
To greet the sun in new disguise

[Final Chorus]
This darkest night, it tests my breath
A silent war, a dance with death
But in the black, a flicker glows
A whispered hope that no one knows
