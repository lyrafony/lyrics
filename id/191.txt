[Intro]
A heart that’s frozen, a mind that’s gone,
Emotions buried, all hope is withdrawn.
Like a shadow, you walk alone,
With a soul that’s colder than the unknown.

[Verso 1]
I gave you warmth, I gave you care,
But you turned away, left me in despair.
You built your walls, so high and strong,
Now you’ll suffer alone, where you belong.

[Pre-Coro]
You’re cold as stone, no warmth in sight,
A heart so empty, devoid of light.
I tried to reach you, I tried to fight,
But you chose the darkness, turned out of spite.

[Coro]
Cold as stone, you’ve sealed your fate,
Left me behind, now it’s too late.
No compassion, no room to breathe,
I’ll watch you fall, I’ll watch you grieve.

[Verso 2]
You wore a mask, but I saw the truth,
A liar, a thief, pretending to soothe.
I trusted you, but now I know,
You were never real, just a shadow.

[Puente]
I’ll burn the bridge, I’ll let it go,
You’ll freeze alone, with nowhere to show.
The warmth you never gave, you never earned,
Now you’ll learn what it’s like to burn.

[Coro]
Cold as stone, you’ve sealed your fate,
Left me behind, now it’s too late.
No compassion, no room to breathe,
I’ll watch you fall, I’ll watch you grieve.
