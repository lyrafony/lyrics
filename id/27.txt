(Verse 1)
We built this love, brick by brick
But now it’s falling, too much to fix
The silence between us is deafening
I never thought we’d be this far apart, remembering

(Pre-Chorus)
I still hear your voice in the quiet nights
But it doesn’t feel like it’s alright
Your touch is gone, but it lingers on
I try to move on, but I’m so far gone

(Chorus)
This is a shattered heart, broken in two
I gave you everything, but you left me blue
I don’t know how to let you go
But I can’t keep holding on to something so cold
This is a shattered heart, torn apart
I tried so hard, but we’ve come too far
I’ll heal with time, I know I will
But right now, this pain’s too real

(Verse 2)
I keep replaying our last goodbye
The words we said, they still make me cry
You said we were fine, but that wasn’t true
Now I’m left here, trying to get through

(Pre-Chorus)
I still hear your voice in the quiet nights
But it doesn’t feel like it’s alright
Your touch is gone, but it lingers on
I try to move on, but I’m so far gone

(Chorus)
This is a shattered heart, broken in two
I gave you everything, but you left me blue
I don’t know how to let you go
But I can’t keep holding on to something so cold
This is a shattered heart, torn apart
I tried so hard, but we’ve come too far
I’ll heal with time, I know I will
But right now, this pain’s too real

(Bridge)
The dreams we had, they fade away
I’m left with the pieces of what you couldn’t say
I thought we’d last, but now it’s clear
You’re not coming back, so I’ll disappear

(Chorus - Variation)
This is a shattered heart, broken in two
I gave you everything, but you left me blue
I don’t know how to let you go
But I can’t keep holding on to something so cold
This is a shattered heart, torn apart
I tried so hard, but we’ve come too far
I’ll heal with time, I know I will
But right now, this pain’s too real

(Outro - Soft)
A shattered heart, it's hard to mend
But I’ll keep walking, 'til I find the end
The love we had, it slipped away
But I’ll move on, one day, one day
