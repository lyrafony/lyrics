[Verse 1]
The world is loud, but you’re my peace,
In every moment, you bring release.
Your voice is a song that calms my mind,
With you, my love, I’m always aligned.

[Pre-Chorus]
No matter where I go, no matter what I do,
Every road leads back to you.

[Chorus]
There’s no one like you, no one who shines,
You light up my world in perfect lines.
Every word you say, every move you make,
Turns my ordinary life into fate.
There’s no one like you, no one so true,
My heart beats only for you.

[Verse 2]
The stars may dazzle, the oceans may gleam,
But nothing compares to your loving beam.
Your touch is magic, it heals my soul,
With you, my darling, I’m finally whole.

[Pre-Chorus]
No distance can break what we’ve begun,
Together we’re two hearts as one.

[Chorus]
There’s no one like you, no one who shines,
You light up my world in perfect lines.
Every word you say, every move you make,
Turns my ordinary life into fate.
There’s no one like you, no one so true,
My heart beats only for you.

[Bridge]
Oh, the world may try to pull us apart,
But you’re forever etched in my heart.
Every glance, every smile, every tear,
Proves that you’re my greatest miracle here.

[Final Chorus]
There’s no one like you, no one who shines,
You light up my world in perfect lines.
Every word you say, every move you make,
Turns my ordinary life into fate.
There’s no one like you, no one so true,
My heart beats only for you.

[Outro]
There’s no one like you…
Only you…
