--

[Verse 1]
Before the stars began to shine
Before the dawn, before the line
A silent voice, a whispered name
That shaped the world without a frame

[Verse 2]
No breath was drawn, no wind was stirred
Yet life began without a word
Invisible hand that spun the skies
And painted light where darkness lies

[Chorus]
The word before time, the breath unseen
The force that moves what lies between
No shape to hold, no face to find
Yet every heart is intertwined

[Verse 3]
Eternal flame without a blaze
A mystery that fills all days
The pulse beneath the stars above
The source of all, the endless love

[Chorus]
The word before time, the breath unseen
The force that moves what lies between
No shape to hold, no face to find
Yet every heart is intertwined

[Bridge]
No walls can bind, no chain can hold
The story that was never told
A spark that lights the void inside
The quiet power where we hide

[Final Chorus]
The word before time, the breath unseen
The force that moves what lies between
No shape to hold, no face to find
Yet every heart is intertwined
