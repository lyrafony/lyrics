[Intro]
I watched the stars fall from the sky,
But I never wondered, I never asked why.
Now I’m left with the pieces of a dream,
Everything’s not what it seemed.

[Verse 1]
We used to talk about forever,
Now I’m trying to forget you, never.
The promises we made, all broken now,
I still don’t understand, I wonder how.
You were my light, but you burned too bright,
Leaving me in the darkness, far from sight.

[Chorus]
Fallen stars, drifting apart,
The love we had, now lost in the dark.
I held you close, but you slipped away,
Now I’m here, left to decay.
Fallen stars, scattered in the night,
All that’s left is fading light.

[Verse 2]
I thought I’d see you again someday,
But now I know you’ve gone away.
The nights are colder, the days feel long,
I’m trying to stay strong, but it feels wrong.
All the memories, they haunt me still,
A love that once bloomed, now lies still.

[Chorus]
Fallen stars, drifting apart,
The love we had, now lost in the dark.
I held you close, but you slipped away,
Now I’m here, left to decay.
Fallen stars, scattered in the night,
All that’s left is fading light.

[Bridge]
I’ve learned to let go, but it’s hard to do,
I’ll never stop missing you.
The sky is empty, but I still search,
For the light that once was our church.

[Chorus]
Fallen stars, drifting apart,
The love we had, now lost in the dark.
I held you close, but you slipped away,
Now I’m here, left to decay.
Fallen stars, scattered in the night,
All that’s left is fading light.

[Outro]
Fallen stars, they burn and fall,
And in the end, we lose it all.
I’ll remember you, and I’ll try to heal,
But the pain is something I’ll always feel.
