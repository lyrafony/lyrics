[Intro]
When the waves crash and the skies turn gray
You’re the calm that keeps me from drifting away

[Verse 1]
Life throws its punches, knocks me to the ground
But you’re the steady hand that turns it around
In the chaos, I hear your voice so clear
Guiding me through the fear, pulling me near

[Pre-Chorus]
Every time I feel like I’m losing control
You remind me I’m whole, you make me whole
No storm can break what we’ve built together

[Chorus]
You’re my anchor in the storm
When the world feels cold and torn
You hold me close, you keep me strong
Through every wave, you prove it’s where I belong
You’re my anchor in the storm
And with you, I’ll weather every form

[Verse 2]
The nights are long, but you light the way
Turning darkness into gold, night into day
Your love is a shelter, a place to rest
In your arms, I’ve found my safest nest

[Pre-Chorus]
Every time I feel like I’m losing control
You remind me I’m whole, you make me whole
No storm can break what we’ve built together

[Chorus]
You’re my anchor in the storm
When the world feels cold and torn
You hold me close, you keep me strong
Through every wave, you prove it’s where I belong
You’re my anchor in the storm
And with you, I’ll weather every form

[Bridge]
Even when the winds howl and the seas rise high
I’ll stand with you beneath the endless sky
You’re my rock, my truth, my guiding flame
With you, I’ll never be the same

[Final Chorus]
You’re my anchor in the storm
When the world feels cold and torn
You hold me close, you keep me strong
Through every wave, you prove it’s where I belong
You’re my anchor in the storm
And with you, I’ll weather every form

[Outro]
Anchor in the storm…
You’re where I belong…
