[Intro]
Footsteps echo, cold wind blowin’ through the blocks…

[Verse 1]
Every turn’s a dead end, every face’s a test,
Trust is a weapon, keep a vest on my chest.
City full of vultures, watchin’ from the dark,
One wrong move, leave your name in the park.

Walk with a past that I can’t erase,
Karma got a price, and it’s starin’ at my face.
Tryna stack bills, but the dirt don’t fade,
Blood on the hands, but the soul won’t trade.

[Pre-Chorus]
Hard roads, cold hearts, trapped in the maze,
Try to break free, but I’m lost in the haze.
Streetlights flicker, shadows creep,
No way out, no rest, no peace.

[Chorus]
Ohhh, runnin’ but the doors stay closed,
Ohhh, fightin’ but the pain still grows.
Ohhh, lookin’ for a sign in the smoke,
But the game don’t change, and the chain won’t choke.

[Verse 2]
Mirror show a face that I barely know,
Eyes full of rage, but the heart stay cold.
Grew up in the war, now the scars run deep,
No lullabies here, only screams in my sleep.

Tried to find faith, but the prayers don’t land,
Tried to find love, but she slipped through my hands.
Money come fast, but it never stays long,
Cycle on repeat like a sad old song.

[Pre-Chorus]
Hard roads, cold hearts, trapped in the maze,
Try to break free, but I’m lost in the haze.
Streetlights flicker, shadows creep,
No way out, no rest, no peace.

[Chorus]
Ohhh, runnin’ but the doors stay closed,
Ohhh, fightin’ but the pain still grows.
Ohhh, lookin’ for a sign in the smoke,
But the game don’t change, and the chain won’t choke.

[Bridge]
One step forward, two steps back,
Tryna leave behind what’s carved in black.

[Verse 3]
Maybe I was born where the sun don’t shine,
Maybe fate laughed when it wrote my lines.
Maybe some roads ain’t meant for escape,
Maybe this life just seals your fate.

[Outro]
Footsteps echo, cold wind blowin’ through the blocks…
