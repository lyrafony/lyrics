[Intro]
Whispers in the wind, calling me to stay,
But the silence is loud, as the night falls away.

[Verse 1]
I walk alone through endless sands,
The sun burns high, but my heart understands.
The wind carries stories of distant lands,
Of hopes and dreams that slip through my hands.

[Pre-Chorus]
The desert speaks in a voice so still,
Echoing the echoes of a broken will.
But somewhere deep within the night,
I find a spark that’s shining bright.

[Chorus]
Winds of solitude, guide me through,
Through the emptiness, to something new.
I am lost, but I am free,
The winds of solitude, they carry me.

[Verse 2]
Cacti stand like silent guards,
Watching as I pass through scars.
The earth beneath my feet feels cold,
Yet in its silence, stories unfold.

[Pre-Chorus]
The whispers of the winds so sweet,
They offer peace in the heat.
A refuge found, a place unknown,
A journey′s end, a path I’ve grown.

[Chorus]
Winds of solitude, guide me through,
Through the emptiness, to something new.
I am lost, but I am free,
The winds of solitude, they carry me.

[Bridge]
And in the quiet, I hear my soul,
A voice that says, “You are whole.”
In the vastness, I find my way,
The winds of solitude, they lead me to stay.

[Outro]
Whispers in the wind, calling me to stay,
The winds of solitude, carry me away.
