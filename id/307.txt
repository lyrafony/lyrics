[Verse 1]
Silent footsteps on the moss,
No need to speak, no need to gloss.
Every breath, a sacred vow,
Only nature hears us now.

[Verse 2]
You walk ahead, I follow slow,
Through trees that only morning know.
Our shadows dance on forest stone,
Together still, yet both alone.

[Chorus]
There’s a language in the air,
In every leaf, a wordless prayer.
No echo, no applause—
Just presence held without a cause.

[Verse 3]
Birdsong fades, the light turns gold,
Time slips quiet, soft and old.
And in the hush we come alive,
Two still hearts that gently thrive.

[Bridge]
No past to chase, no path to lead,
No hunger left, no urgent need.
Just you and I, in quiet grace,
Two souls in one, unhurried pace.

[Outro]
Silent footsteps, fading slow,
Where we end, the wild will know.
And if one day we walk apart,
The forest keeps our single heart.
