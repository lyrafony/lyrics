[Verse 1]
Your voice is static, but you demand my faith,
A hollow echo that can’t escape its cage.
You built your throne on shifting sand,
But I won’t kneel to a trembling hand.

[Pre-Chorus]
The wires are cut, the signal’s gone,
No more lies to keep me drawn.

[Chorus]
Static gods, they scream in vain,
Their empty power lost in the rain.
I’ll break the chains, I’ll burn the shrine,
No static god will ever define.

[Verse 2]
Your rules are shadows, fading with time,
Built for control, not for the climb.
I see the cracks beneath your crown,
The fall is near—it’s tumbling down.

[Pre-Chorus]
The wires are cut, the signal’s gone,
No more lies to keep me drawn.

[Chorus]
Static gods, they scream in vain,
Their empty power lost in the rain.
I’ll break the chains, I’ll burn the shrine,
No static god will ever define.

[Bridge]
Let the statues crumble, let the altars break,
No force above me—I make my fate.
The static fades, the truth ignites,
A spark of freedom cuts through the night.

[Final Chorus]
Static gods, they fade to dust,
Their fragile kingdoms built on lust.
I’ll rise above, I’ll claim my name,
No static god can steal my flame.
