[Intro]
Tired of the weight, tired of the calls,
Only hit me up when your whole world falls.

[Verse 1]
Always got a problem, always need a hand,
But where were you when I could barely stand?
Late nights drowning, fighting my fights,
You were MIA, outta sight.

[Pre-Chorus]
Now you’re knocking, crying, begging, ″Bro, please...″
But where was your love when I was on my knees?

[Chorus]
Ain’t no shoulders left for you to lean,
Used to hold you up, now I let you be.
Every time you call, it’s the same old scene,
But I ain’t got the time, gotta live for me.

[Verse 2]
Draining my soul, taking my light,
Only come around when your world ain′t right.
I was your rock, I was your guide,
But when I fell, you stepped aside.

[Pre-Chorus]
Now you’re knocking, crying, begging, ″Bro, please...″
But where was your love when I was on my knees?

[Chorus]
Ain’t no shoulders left for you to lean,
Used to hold you up, now I let you be.
Every time you call, it’s the same old scene,
But I ain’t got the time, gotta live for me.

[Bridge]
No hate, no rage, just lessons learned,
Gave too much, now the tables turned.
Took my kindness, played me cold,
Now I walk alone, heart made of gold.

[Chorus]
Ain’t no shoulders left for you to lean,
Used to hold you up, now I let you be.
Every time you call, it’s the same old scene,
But I ain’t got the time, gotta live for me.

[Outro]
No hate, no weight, just moving on,
Your calls go unanswered, ‘cause now I’m gone.
