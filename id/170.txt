[Intro]
Another night, another fight,
Chasin′ dreams, but the light’s outta sight.

[Verse 1]
I’m walkin’ through the dark, tryna find my way,
Lost in the city, where the dreams decay.
Used to have a spark, now it’s all just gray,
People say they care, but they all fade away.

I see ‘em talkin′ loud, but it don’t mean a thing,
Chasin’ fake success, they don’t know the sting.
I gave my heart, but it’s all been torn,
In a world of promises, but none are born.

[Pre-Chorus]
They tell me keep pushin′, but my heart’s grown cold,
Feelin’ like a story that’s already been told.
I’m searchin’ for a light that’s deep in the night,
But I can’t find a way, no matter how hard I fight.

[Chorus]
Ohhh, fading lights in the sky,
I’m lookin’ for a reason, but I don’t know why.
Ohhh, the road feels so long,
Tryna hold on, but the light’s already gone.

[Verse 2]
Told ‘em I was ready, but I felt outta place,
Kept on runnin’ from the truth that I had to face.
All the friends I thought I had just disappeared,
Now it’s just me, fightin’ through the fear.

They don’t know the cost of chasin′ a dream,
How it breaks you down, tears apart your seams.
But I keep on goin′, one foot in front of the other,
Even though the light’s dim, I can’t go back, I’m a brother.

[Pre-Chorus]
They tell me keep pushin′, but my heart’s grown cold,
Feelin’ like a story that’s already been told.
I’m searchin’ for a light that’s deep in the night,
But I can’t find a way, no matter how hard I fight.

[Chorus]
Ohhh, fading lights in the sky,
I’m lookin’ for a reason, but I don’t know why.
Ohhh, the road feels so long,
Tryna hold on, but the light’s already gone.

[Bridge]
I see the shadows creep,
But I still believe in the light I seek.

[Verse 3]
Maybe the light ain′t something I can see,
Maybe it’s somethin′ inside of me.
I’ll find my way, even when it’s tough,
The road’s been hard, but I’ll rise above.

[Outro]
Fading lights… fading lights…
But I’ll keep pushin’, I’ll keep fightin′ through the night...
