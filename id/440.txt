[Verse 1]
The days stretch on, no word, no sign
A quiet void where hopes resign
No voices rise, no answers come
Just empty skies and beating drum

[Verse 2]
The night is long, the heart is tired
A faith that’s worn, a soul inspired
Yet still I wait without a sound
In silent trust that knows no bound

[Chorus]
The long silence, still I stay
Though shadows whisper, I won’t stray
No light yet shines, no thunder breaks
But in this hush, my spirit wakes

[Verse 3]
The waiting feels like endless sea
But something pulls and carries me
A steady hand I cannot see
Guides steps through doubt and mystery

[Chorus]
The long silence, still I stay
Though shadows whisper, I won’t stray
No light yet shines, no thunder breaks
But in this hush, my spirit wakes

[Bridge]
When silence reigns and hope seems thin
It’s then the quiet fights within
A faith that holds beyond the night
A love that waits to bring the light

[Final Chorus]
The long silence, still I stay
Though shadows whisper, I won’t stray
No light yet shines, no thunder breaks
But in this hush, my spirit wakes
