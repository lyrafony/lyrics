[Verse 1]
Shadows spinning on the silver wall,
Mirror lights are calling all.
Neon dreams in a velvet tide,
Lose yourself, let the rhythm ride.

[Chorus]
Mirror lights, shining bright,
Twist and turn into the night.
Catch your smile, catch your soul,
Under mirror lights, we lose control.

[Verse 2]
Velvet echoes on the marble floor,
Feet donâ€²t touch the ground no more.
Colors blending, hearts collide,
In the mirror lights, we come alive.

[Chorus]
Mirror lights, shining bright,
Twist and turn into the night.
Catch your smile, catch your soul,
Under mirror lights, we lose control.

[Bridge]
Spin me faster, blur the lines,
Lost in sparkle, lost in time.
Whispered laughter fills the air,
Mirror lights are everywhere.

[Chorus]
Mirror lights, shining bright,
Twist and turn into the night.
Catch your smile, catch your soul,
Under mirror lights, we lose control.

[Outro]
Under mirror lights,
We lose, we lose control...
