[Verse 1]
Whispers wrapped in silk and gold
Promises bought, but never sold
Invisible hands that bind
Chains unseen around the mind

[Verse 2]
Eyes that watch from gilded thrones
Counting coins like sacred stones
The weight of wealth, a heavy crown
That keeps the lost and weak bowed down

[Chorus]
Golden chains, they bind and steal
The soul’s true voice they try to seal
But in the heart a fire remains
Breaking free from golden chains

[Verse 3]
Silent deals and shadowed trusts
Turn the strong to broken dust
Yet from the depths, a strength unseen
Rises up, serene, unseen

[Chorus]
Golden chains, they bind and steal
The soul’s true voice they try to seal
But in the heart a fire remains
Breaking free from golden chains

[Bridge]
No crown of gold can last for long
When faith is fierce and hope is strong
The chains may clink, the walls may close
But light inside will always grow

[Final Chorus]
Golden chains, they bind and steal
The soul’s true voice they try to seal
But in the heart a fire remains
Breaking free from golden chains
