[Verse 1]
I’ve chased perfection, a flawless ideal,
A picture of life that never feels real.
But every crack tells its own story,
Of battles fought and moments of glory.
The jagged edges, the uneven lines,
Are proof of living, not wasted time.
Perfection fades, but authenticity stays,
A mosaic built from our wildest days.

[Pre-Chorus]
It’s hard to love what’s rough around the seams,
To cherish the broken, the fractured dreams.
But beauty lives in the flaws we bear,
In the raw and messy, the painfully rare.

[Chorus]
There’s beauty in the cracks, in the things undone,
In the wayward paths where we’ve only begun.
Every flaw is a thread in the tapestry wide,
A masterpiece painted with nothing to hide.
Through imperfection, we truly shine,
Unpolished gems, uniquely divine.
This is my truth, my sacred art,
The beauty found in an imperfect heart.

[Verse 2]
The world demands we smooth every edge,
Hide the chaos, keep it all on pledge.
But I see grace in the crooked lines,
In mismatched pieces that intertwine.
Each scar is a map of where I’ve been,
A reminder of how far I’ve seen.
The cracks let light into the soul,
Making us whole when we feel uncontrolled.

[Bridge]
Maybe perfection isn’t the goal we seek,
But finding wonder in how unique.
The flaws we carry are badges of pride,
Proof we’re alive, open and tried.
So I’ll embrace the cracks, let them glow,
For through imperfection, true beauty will show.

[Outro]
Find the beauty in the flawed design,
In every stumble, every sign.
No more hiding, no more disguise,
The cracks reveal where greatness lies.
Find the beauty… and let me see,
The art of being unapologetically me.
