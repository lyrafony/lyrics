[Verse 1]
It didn’t come with trumpet sound
No sunrise split the sky around
It crept in low, with quiet grace
A warmth that touched the coldest place

[Verse 2]
I didn’t ask, I didn’t seek
I had no words, I felt too weak
But in the stillness of the pain
I felt the stir of life again

[Chorus]
Hope awakens not with fire
But with a breath that climbs the wire
It lifts the soul without a sound
And plants its feet on solid ground

[Verse 3]
It doesn’t fix what came before
But opens up a different door
Where peace and sorrow coexist
And nothing true is ever missed

[Chorus]
Hope awakens not with fire
But with a breath that climbs the wire
It lifts the soul without a sound
And plants its feet on solid ground

[Bridge]
I thought it died—I laid it down
But it grew roots beneath the ground
And now it rises, not in haste
But with a quiet, steady grace

[Final Chorus]
Hope awakens, small and slow
Like spring beneath the last of snow
It doesn’t ask, it simply stays
And leads me on through brighter days
