Title: Finding meaning in chaos

[Verse 1]
I’m lost inside a stormy haze,
No compass points, no guiding blaze.
The world spins fast, it pulls apart,
And leaves me clutching at my heart.
Questions echo through the night,
Searching for some distant light.
But even in this endless spin,
There’s something calling deep within.

[Pre-Chorus]
When chaos reigns and nothing’s clear,
And every step is laced with fear,
I’ll find the thread that ties it all,
A reason hidden through the fall.

[Chorus]
In the chaos, there’s a rhythm,
A pulse beneath the static prison.
Every broken piece has its place,
Even storms can show us grace.
Through the madness, I will listen,
To the whispers of existence.
In the chaos, there’s a song,
A melody to carry me along.

[Verse 2]
The noise surrounds, it drowns my mind,
Too many voices, none aligned.
Yet somewhere past the disarray,
I glimpse a brighter kind of day.
Each shattered dream, each fleeting spark,
Builds a fire in the endless dark.
Though answers hide, they’re not too far—
They’re written in the scars we are.

[Pre-Chorus]
When chaos reigns and nothing’s clear,
And every step is laced with fear,
I’ll find the thread that ties it all,
A reason hidden through the fall.

[Chorus]
In the chaos, there’s a rhythm,
A pulse beneath the static prison.
Every broken piece has its place,
Even storms can show us grace.
Through the madness, I will listen,
To the whispers of existence.
In the chaos, there’s a song,
A melody to carry me along.

[Bridge]
Maybe meaning isn’t something to find,
Maybe it’s built in the ties that bind.
The threads connect, though frayed they seem,
Weaving life into a greater dream.
So I’ll embrace the mess, the unknown fight,
For beauty lives in wrongs made right.

[Outro]
In the chaos, there’s a way,
Through tangled paths, I’ll find my stay.
The noise may roar, but I’ll remain,
Listening close for love’s refrain.
In the chaos… there’s a song,
A melody to carry me along.
