[Verse 1]
It wasn’t loud, it wasn’t grand
No flash of light, no thundered command
Just stillness deep within my chest
A whisper low, a soft request

[Verse 2]
No crowd to hear, no need to speak
Just one small breath, one moment weak
I closed my eyes, let silence grow
And in that hush, I came to know

[Chorus]
The quiet yes that changed my path
No fear, no fame, no need for wrath
It broke no walls, it raised no sound
But all I lost is what I found

[Verse 3]
No promises, no terms agreed
Just trust that grew where I had need
A gentle pull I can’t define
That moved the soul I thought was mine

[Chorus]
The quiet yes that changed my path
No fear, no fame, no need for wrath
It broke no walls, it raised no sound
But all I lost is what I found

[Bridge]
Some answers shout, some visions blind
But truth arrives in stiller time
And when I knelt, not seen, not pressed
The world began with one small yes

[Final Chorus]
The quiet yes that changed my path
No fear, no fame, no need for wrath
It broke no walls, it raised no sound
But all I lost is what I found
