(Verse 1)
Late night, stolen glances in the dark
Heartbeats racing every time we meet apart
Every touch, every whisper, I can’t lie
But we both know we gotta keep this quiet

(Pre-Chorus)
No one knows, no one sees
But the fire’s burning underneath
We can’t speak, we can’t show
But the way you look at me, oh, it tells me so

(Chorus)
It’s a hidden love, behind the scenes
A secret world, just you and me
Every word, every move, it’s undercover
But I don’t wanna hide forever
It’s a hidden love, and I can't breathe
When I’m not with you, it’s killing me
We’re a secret story, a stolen dream
But how long 'til we break free?

(Verse 2)
Your name is a whisper I can’t say
In a crowded room, gotta look away
But when we’re alone, it’s a different game
No pretending, no more shame

(Pre-Chorus)
No one knows, no one sees
But the fire’s burning underneath
We can’t speak, we can’t show
But the way you look at me, oh, it tells me so

(Chorus)
It’s a hidden love, behind the scenes
A secret world, just you and me
Every word, every move, it’s undercover
But I don’t wanna hide forever
It’s a hidden love, and I can't breathe
When I’m not with you, it’s killing me
We’re a secret story, a stolen dream
But how long 'til we break free?

(Bridge)
I don’t wanna whisper, I wanna shout
I don’t wanna hide, I want the world to find out
If love is real, why should we pretend?
Tell me, tell me, is this how it ends?

(Chorus - Variation)
It’s a hidden love, behind the scenes
A secret world, just you and me
Every word, every move, it’s undercover
But I don’t wanna hide forever
It’s a hidden love, and I can't breathe
When I’m not with you, it’s killing me
We’re a secret story, a stolen dream
But how long 'til we break free?

(Outro)
Maybe one day, we won’t have to hide
Maybe someday, we’ll stand in the light
But ‘til then, it’s just you and me
In this hidden love, where no one can see
