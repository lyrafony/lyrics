[Verse 1]
I sat with my head in trembling hands
No future, no fight, no strength to stand
The world kept turning, I stayed still
A ghost inside a body chilled

[Verse 2]
I didn’t ask to be held that night
Didn’t look for faith or light
But something soft broke through the ache
A breath I didn’t know I’d take

[Chorus]
It wasn’t loud, it wasn’t bright
No miracles, no blinding light
Just quiet arms that wouldn’t move
Though I gave them every reason to
I found no proof, no thunder sign
But I was held, and I survived
The day I almost gave up

[Verse 3]
I wrote a note I never sent
Spoke words I swore were permanent
But tears came slow and wouldn’t leave
Like mercy learning how to breathe

[Chorus]
It wasn’t loud, it wasn’t bright
No miracles, no blinding light
Just quiet arms that wouldn’t move
Though I gave them every reason to
I found no proof, no thunder sign
But I was held, and I survived
The day I almost gave up

[Bridge]
No one knew, no one saw
But something holy touched the flaw
Not in fire, not in sound
But in the stillness underground

[Final Chorus]
Now I remember when I break
That silence saved me, not escape
No shining sky, no open door
Just love I never asked before
No answers clear, but still enough
For the day I almost gave up
