[Verse 1]
Invisible threads weave through the air,
binding hearts in ways we can’t declare.
A silent pulse, a shared embrace,
connecting souls across time and space.

[Pre-Chorus]
We’re all fragments of something vast,
a tapestry stitched from futures past.

[Chorus]
Threads of the unseen hold us tight,
woven in shadows, out of sight.
Though we’re distant, we’re never apart,
linked by whispers etched in the heart.

[Verse 2]
Every word, every touch leaves a trace,
a ripple that shapes the human race.
The smallest spark can light the way,
turning strangers into kin someday.

[Bridge]
Beneath the surface, the bonds remain,
a quiet force through joy and pain.
Even when lost, we’re still entwined,
a cosmic dance of humankind.

[Final Section]
Threads of the unseen hold us tight,
woven in shadows, out of sight.
Though we’re distant, we’re never apart,
linked by whispers etched in the heart.
