[Intro]
Broken glass and a silent scream,
Mirrors shatter in a haunted dream.

[Verse 1]
I see a face I don′t recall,
Fragments dancing across the wall.
A thousand versions I can′t hold,
All the stories left untold.

[Pre-Chorus]
Every crack shows who I was,
Every shard, a secret lost.
Reflections twist, reflections lie,
Still I stare and wonder why.

[Chorus]
Fractured reflections, falling apart,
Pieces of soul, pieces of heart.
Can′t find the truth inside the glass,
Chasing a ghost that never lasts.

[Verse 2]
Smiling masks, a veil of light,
Hiding the battles fought each night.
I reach out, but it slips away,
Another dream gone astray.

[Pre-Chorus]
Every crack shows who I was,
Every shard, a secret lost.
Reflections twist, reflections lie,
Still I stare and wonder why.

[Chorus]
Fractured reflections, falling apart,
Pieces of soul, pieces of heart.
Can′t find the truth inside the glass,
Chasing a ghost that never lasts.

[Bridge]
Maybe I′m more than broken views,
More than memories I can′t use.
In the cracks, new colors gleam,
A shattered soul can still dream.

[Outro]
Fractured reflections, fading slow,
Still there′s beauty in what we don′t know.
