[Verse 1]
I see the future in my mind,
Whispers loud, but I’m confined.
Time is ticking, but it’s still,
Fading memories, what’s the thrill?

I feel the echoes of a life,
Where everything’s cut like a knife.
A world that’s lost, a dream that’s gone,
But I keep pushing, moving on.

[Chorus]
Echoes of tomorrow, calling me,
Through the storm, through the noise, I’m free.
No turning back, no place to hide,
In the echoes, I’ll collide.

[Verse 2]
Waking up in shades of gray,
Future’s blurred, but I’ll find my way.
Falling down, but I still rise,
With every failure, I’ll realize.

Through the dust, through the fire,
Chasing dreams that never tire.
A different world, a different view,
I’ll make it happen, I’ll break through.

[Chorus]
Echoes of tomorrow, calling me,
Through the storm, through the noise, I’m free.
No turning back, no place to hide,
In the echoes, I’ll collide.

[Bridge]
Can you hear them? The call is near,
Voices echoing, crystal clear.
Through the chaos, I will rise,
Find my way through endless skies.

[Chorus]
Echoes of tomorrow, calling me,
Through the storm, through the noise, I’m free.
No turning back, no place to hide,
In the echoes, I’ll collide.
