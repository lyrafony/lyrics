[Verse]
From the very start, I knew there was something in you,
Not just in your words, but in how you make me feel too,
Our hearts beating to the same rhythm, side by side,
Every step we take, we're moving with the tide.

[Verse]
We've faced the hardest times, and together we made it through,
Your loyalty gave me strength when I was feeling bruised,
You’re the mirror of the person I aspire to be,
The trust I have in you, it's all I need to see.

[Pre-Chorus]
I don’t trust anyone in this world like I trust you,
In you, I see a love that’s pure and true.

[Chorus]
I’ll be with you 'til the end, I won’t let go,
'Cause I know in your eyes, I’ve found a place to grow,
I can’t promise perfection, but one thing is clear,
In you, I find a backing, a love so near.

[Verse]
I have absolute trust in my God,
And you’ve earned second place, it's where you stand.
In you, I found what I was looking for,
Values and principles I’ll always adore.

[Verse]
You and I are strong, united in what’s true,
Nothing can break us, no matter what we go through,
Together we’ll reach where others cannot see,
'Cause at the end of the day, you’ll always be with me.

[Pre-Chorus]
I don’t trust anyone in this world like I trust you,
In you, I see a love that’s pure and true.

[Chorus]
I’ll be with you 'til the end, I won’t let go,
'Cause I know in your eyes, I’ve found a place to grow,
I can’t promise perfection, but one thing is clear,
In you, I find a backing, a love so near.
