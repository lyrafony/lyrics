[Intro]
Feel the rhythm…
Let’s go…

[Verse 1]
The beat drops low, it syncs with my heart
Every pulse is a signal, a brand-new start
Your body moves like it’s part of the sound
Together we’re dancing, no feet on the ground

It’s in the air, it’s under our skin
This rhythm’s alive, let the magic begin
No need for words, the music will say
What our hearts already know anyway

[Pre-Chorus]
Step by step, we’re falling in line
Your heartbeat matches mine every time
No fight, no fear, just the groove we create
Two souls connected by fate

[Chorus]
Latido perfecto, feel the beat align
Our hearts are dancing to the same design
In this moment, nothing else matters
We’re lost in the rhythm, caught in the chapters
Latido perfecto, love takes control
The music guides us, it’s taking its toll
Together we move, like waves in the sea
Baby, this is our destiny

[Verse 2]
The bassline hums, it’s pulling me near
Your energy’s electric, I feel you clear
We’re riding the rhythm, no end in sight
This night’s eternal, burning so bright

Every touch, every step, it’s a sign
We’re two frequencies tuned in one time
No limits here, just pure emotion
This beat’s the key to our devotion

[Pre-Chorus]
Step by step, we’re falling in line
Your heartbeat matches mine every time
No fight, no fear, just the groove we create
Two souls connected by fate

[Chorus]
Latido perfecto, feel the beat align
Our hearts are dancing to the same design
In this moment, nothing else matters
We’re lost in the rhythm, caught in the chapters
Latido perfecto, love takes control
The music guides us, it’s taking its toll
Together we move, like waves in the sea
Baby, this is our destiny

[Bridge]
Ooooh…
Feel the rhythm take over, deeper than before
Our hearts are beating louder, we’re craving more
No boundaries now, just you and me
This is our symphony

[Final Chorus]
Latido perfecto, feel the beat align
Our hearts are dancing to the same design
In this moment, nothing else matters
We’re lost in the rhythm, caught in the chapters
Latido perfecto, love takes control
The music guides us, it’s taking its toll
Together we move, like waves in the sea
Baby, this is our destiny

[Outro]
Latido perfecto…
Feel it…
