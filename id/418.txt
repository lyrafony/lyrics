[Verse 1]
I grasp for threads beyond my sight
A fragile hold in endless night
No proof to claim, no signs to see
Just whispers soft surrounding me

[Verse 2]
The ground may shift beneath my feet
Yet still I trust what feels discreet
A presence felt but not displayed
A light that lingers in the shade

[Chorus]
I hold to the unseen, firm and tight
Through darkest day and loneliest night
Though doubts may rise and questions scream
I cling to hope, to the unseen dream

[Verse 3]
The road is long, the steps unsure
But faith endures and will endure
A silent guide, a steady hand
That leads me through the shadowed land

[Chorus]
I hold to the unseen, firm and tight
Through darkest day and loneliest night
Though doubts may rise and questions scream
I cling to hope, to the unseen dream

[Bridge]
No need for proof to light the way
When trust is born in shades of gray
And in the void, I find my peace
A faith that waits and will not cease

[Final Chorus]
I hold to the unseen, firm and tight
Through darkest day and loneliest night
Though doubts may rise and questions scream
I cling to hope, to the unseen dream
