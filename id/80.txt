[Verse 1]
I built my dreams on shifting sand,
a fragile house that couldn’t stand.
The horizon cracked beneath my feet,
yet somehow I found a rhythm sweet.

[Pre-Chorus]
What once was whole now splits apart,
but broken edges shape my heart.

[Chorus]
Fractured horizons, they break and bend,
but in the cracks, new paths ascend.
Through shattered skies, I learn to fly,
finding light where shadows lie.

[Verse 2]
The map I followed lost its lines,
the stars above rearranged their signs.
But every fall taught me to rise,
to see the beauty in surprise.

[Bridge]
The pieces don’t fit like they used to do,
but imperfection feels more true.
In chaos, there’s grace, a spark to ignite,
a fractured horizon still holds the light.

[Final Section]
Fractured horizons, they break and bend,
but in the cracks, new paths ascend.
Through shattered skies, I learn to fly,
finding light where shadows lie.
