(Verse 1)
You played your games, thought I’d stay down
Now I’m the queen, you lost the crown
Said I was weak, but look who’s strong
You lit the fire, now you're gone

(Pre-Chorus)
Now you’re watching from the sidelines
Regretting every little white lie
Oh, you thought that I would cry?
Baby, watch me shine, watch me rise

(Chorus)
I took the pain, turned it into diamonds
Now you see me, now you're silent
Thought you broke me? Guess again
This is my broken heart revenge
Now I glow, now I thrive
You’re the echo left behind
Thought you had me? Think again
This is my broken heart revenge

(Verse 2)
Karma’s real, she’s on my side
Every tear I shed just multiplied
Now I got that glow, glow, glow
While you’re stuck so low, low, low

(Pre-Chorus)
Now you’re watching from the sidelines
Regretting every little white lie
Oh, you thought that I would cry?
Baby, watch me shine, watch me rise

(Chorus)
I took the pain, turned it into diamonds
Now you see me, now you're silent
Thought you broke me? Guess again
This is my broken heart revenge
Now I glow, now I thrive
You’re the echo left behind
Thought you had me? Think again
This is my broken heart revenge

(Bridge)
Did you think I’d beg for more?
Now I’m dancing on your ghost
Every scar became my gold
And you’re the story left untold

(Chorus - Variation)
I took the pain, turned it into diamonds
Now you see me, now you're silent
Thought you broke me? Guess again
This is my broken heart revenge
Now I glow, now I thrive
You’re the echo left behind
Thought you had me? Think again
This is my broken heart revenge

(Outro - Whispered)
Now you’re nothing but a name
In a song you’ll never claim
