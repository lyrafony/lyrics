[Verse 1]
I stood where all I knew was lost
The ground was cold, the line was crossed
The fire had burned through every claim
And left behind no trace of name

[Verse 2]
But in that place where nothing stayed
Where all I built was torn and frayed
I felt a stillness, deep and wide
A seed of life I could not hide

[Chorus]
From ashes rise, not as before
But stronger, quieter, something more
Not what was broken, glued and bent
But what the fire was always meant

[Verse 3]
The past is not my home or weight
The flame did not destroyâ€”create
And what I feared would be the end
Became the place I learned to mend

[Chorus]
From ashes rise, not as before
But stronger, quieter, something more
Not what was broken, glued and bent
But what the fire was always meant

[Bridge]
I wear no crown, I seek no stage
But walk reborn from fire and age
The ruins now beneath my feet
Are where the soul and mercy meet

[Final Chorus]
From ashes rise, and still I stand
Not by my strength, not by my hand
But by the breath that lit the flame
And called me gently by no name
