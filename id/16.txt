[Verse]
I used to think that truth would set me free,
But now I see the chains it put on me.
Honesty’s a weight too heavy to hold,
A story rewritten, but never retold.

[Verse]
They’ll cheer for lies as long as they’re sweet,
Turn a blind eye to truth on repeat.
Sugar-coated stories, that’s what they crave,
But reality hits, they can't escape the wave.

[Pre-Chorus]
They shut their doors, they turn away,
A lonely road for those who say—
What’s real, what hurts, what breaks the mold,
Truth’s a curse, or so I’m told.

[Chorus]
The truth will bring you trouble, that's all it will do,
It'll make you a target, an enemy too.
The world loves comfort, it fears the fight,
So tell them the truth, and you’re out of their sight.

[Verse]
I’ve seen the whispers tear people apart,
They praise deception, call it an art.
If you don’t bend, if you don’t fall,
They’ll silence your voice, erase it all.

[Verse]
But I’d rather walk this road alone,
Than live a lie and call it home.
Let them judge, let them criticize,
I’ll stand my ground, no disguise.

[Pre-Chorus]
They shut their doors, they turn away,
A lonely road for those who say—
What’s real, what hurts, what breaks the mold,
Truth’s a curse, or so I’m told.

[Chorus]
The truth won’t save you, it won’t set you free,
It’ll make you a target, an enemy.
The world loves comfort, it fears the fight,
So tell them the truth, and you’re out of their sight.

[Verse]
I won’t be silent, I won’t be tamed,
I’ll bear the weight, I’ll take the pain.
If truth’s a burden, I’ll carry it through,
I’d rather be hated than live like you.
