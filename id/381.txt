Title: Light Through Cracks

[Verse 1]
I tried to hide what wasn’t whole
To patch the wounds, protect control
But in the dark, the silence knew
The strongest light comes breaking through

[Verse 2]
It’s not the flawless that reflects
But every line the world rejects
The broken skin, the weary face
Reveal a softer kind of grace

[Chorus]
There’s light through cracks the proud can’t see
It finds the lost, it sets them free
It doesn’t blind, it doesn’t burn
It waits until the soul can turn

[Verse 3]
The shattered edge, the splintered wall
Became the place I heard the call
Not loud, not clean, but deep and near
A light that speaks through what we fear

[Chorus]
There’s light through cracks the proud can’t see
It finds the lost, it sets them free
It doesn’t blind, it doesn’t burn
It waits until the soul can turn

[Bridge]
Let no one hide their fractured frame
It’s through the break we lose the shame
And when we stop pretending gold
The real begins, the truth takes hold

[Final Chorus]
There’s light through cracks the dark won’t close
It moves where only mercy goes
And what once seemed too weak to stand
Becomes the lamp in wounded hands
