[Verse 1]
A distant vision, soft and clear
Where pain dissolves, and hearts draw near
A world remade, pure and bright
Bathed in eternal light

[Verse 2]
No tears to fall, no night to come
A place where all are truly one
The broken healed, the lost restored
A kingdom built on love adored

[Chorus]
New heaven, new earth, a fresh embrace
A timeless, boundless sacred place
Where hope is born and sorrow ends
The song of peace that never bends

[Verse 3]
The old has passed, the new remains
No more shadows, no more chains
A future written without fear
The promise whispered in the clear

[Chorus]
New heaven, new earth, a fresh embrace
A timeless, boundless sacred place
Where hope is born and sorrow ends
The song of peace that never bends

[Bridge]
Beyond the veil, beyond the night
A dawn that breaks with perfect light
The dawn of love, the final birth
Of new heaven, new earth

[Final Chorus]
New heaven, new earth, a fresh embrace
A timeless, boundless sacred place
Where hope is born and sorrow ends
The song of peace that never bends
