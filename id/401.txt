[Verse 1]
Once a fire burned bright and clear
Now the glow begins to disappear
Flickering faint through clouded eyes
A silent spark that slowly dies

[Verse 2]
Words once bold now softly fall
Echoes lost in hollow hall
Faith that once stood strong and true
Fading into shades of blue

[Chorus]
Dimming flame, fading light
Lost within the endless night
Hearts grown cold, voices tame
Lost beneath the dimming flame

[Verse 3]
The warmth once shared is now withdrawn
A distant light at early dawn
Longing for a spark to rise
To break through veils of darkened skies

[Chorus]
Dimming flame, fading light
Lost within the endless night
Hearts grown cold, voices tame
Lost beneath the dimming flame

[Bridge]
Yet in the dark, a hope remains
A whispered call that breaks the chains
To fan the spark, revive the soul
And make the broken spirit whole

[Final Chorus]
Dimming flame, fading light
Lost within the endless night
Hearts grown cold, voices tame
Lost beneath the dimming flame
