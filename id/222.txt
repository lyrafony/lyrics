[Verse 1]
The morning light breaks through the sky,
Your whispers echo as the shadows die.
In the quiet dawn, I hold you near,
Every promise feels so crystal clear.

[Pre-Chorus]
We’ve walked through storms, we’ve faced the night,
But here we are, bathed in golden light.

[Chorus]
Promises at dawn, painted in the skies,
I’ll never let you go, no matter the lies.
With every sunrise, I’ll prove it’s true,
My heart belongs to only you.
Promises at dawn, they’ll never fade,
Our love will bloom, unafraid.

[Verse 2]
The world may change, the seasons turn,
But in your arms, there’s so much to learn.
Each moment with you feels like a dream,
A melody that flows through every stream.

[Pre-Chorus]
We’ve built this fire, it burns so bright,
Even in the darkest hours of night.

[Chorus]
Promises at dawn, painted in the skies,
I’ll never let you go, no matter the lies.
With every sunrise, I’ll prove it’s true,
My heart belongs to only you.
Promises at dawn, they’ll never fade,
Our love will bloom, unafraid.

[Bridge]
Oh, the stars may fall, the winds may cry,
But our love will stand, it will never die.
Every word I say, every vow I make,
Is written in the heavens for us to take.

[Final Chorus]
Promises at dawn, painted in the skies,
I’ll never let you go, no matter the lies.
With every sunrise, I’ll prove it’s true,
My heart belongs to only you.
Promises at dawn, they’ll never fade,
Our love will bloom, unafraid.

[Outro]
Promises at dawn…
Forever ours…
