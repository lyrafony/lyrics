[Verse]
I light my screen, they flood my mind,
With ads that tell me how to shine.
The perfect life, the flawless dream,
But nothing’s ever what it seems.

[Verse]
Chasing likes on Instagram,
Hiding scars behind the glam.
No one speaks of fear or doubt,
Just fake success, the perfect plan.

[Pre-Chorus]
Does anybody feel the same?
Trapped inside this hollow game?
If we fall, would they still care,
Or just pretend we weren’t there?

[Chorus]
The city shines, but it's all a lie,
Actors playing scripted lives.
Drop your mask, they'll tear you apart,
The real you won’t make it far.

[Verse]
Even I have played my part,
Smiled through pain to hide the dark.
But every lie we choose to live
Leaves a scar we can’t forgive.

[Verse]
So I walk the road alone,
No fake love, just flesh and bone.
Better to fade than burn so bright,
If all that shines is built on lies.

[Pre-Chorus]
Does anybody feel the same?
Trapped inside this hollow game?
If we fall, would they still care,
Or just pretend we weren’t there?

[Chorus]
The city shines, but it's all a lie,
Actors playing scripted lives.
Drop your mask, they'll tear you apart,
The real you won’t make it far.

[Verse]
One by one, the lights will fade,
Trends will die, and names will change.
But in the end, when nothing’s left,
Did we live, or just pretend?
