(Verse 1)
We had the spark, we had the fire
We had the words, but not the timing
Late-night talks, hearts on the line
But we kept waiting, now it's left behind

(Pre-Chorus)
Maybe in another life, maybe in a different time
We would cross that fragile line
But now we're just a "what if" in my mind

(Chorus)
We were almost love, almost fate
Almost everything, but just too late
Like a dream that fades with dawn
A song that’s left half sung
We were perfect in a world that never was

(Verse 2)
Every touch, every glance
Felt like more, but we never took the chance
Always close, but miles apart
Holding back with restless hearts

(Pre-Chorus)
Maybe in another life, maybe in a different time
We would cross that fragile line
But now we're just a "what if" in my mind

(Chorus)
We were almost love, almost fate
Almost everything, but just too late
Like a dream that fades with dawn
A song that’s left half sung
We were perfect in a world that never was

(Bridge)
Tell me, do you ever wonder?
Do you wish we tried much harder?
Or are you happy with the way it all went wrong?

(Chorus - Variation)
We were almost love, almost fate
Almost everything, but just too late
Like a dream that fades with dawn
A song that’s left half sung
We were perfect in a world that never was

(Outro)
Now you're just a memory, a whisper in the air
The love we never had, but I still feel it there
