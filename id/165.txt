[Intro]
Chasin′ shadows in the light,
Will I find my way tonight?

[Verse 1]
I’ve been lost in the dark, tryin′ to find my spark,
Every step feels heavy, but I’m pushin’ through the dark.
I keep dreamin’ of a life that’s real,
No more chasin′ the lies, I need to feel.

[Pre-Chorus]
Shadows on the wall, but I’m still runnin′,
I won’t stop ‘til the light comes back, I’m comin’.
No more fear, just fire in my eyes,
Chasin′ shadows ‘til I touch the skies.

[Chorus]
Chasin’ shadows in the night,
I’ll find the way, I’ll make it right.
No more runnin’, no more fight,
I’m breakin′ free from this endless flight.
Yeah, chasin′ shadows in the night,
I’ll find the way, I’ll make it right.
No more runnin’, no more fight,
I’m breakin′ free from this endless flight.

[Verse 2]
I’ve been searchin′ for the answers, but they hide,
Feelin′ like I’m trapped, can’t run, can’t hide.
But I’ll keep movin’, I’ll keep findin’ my way,
‘Cause I know the light is gonna shine one day.

[Pre-Chorus]
Shadows on the wall, but I’m still runnin’,
I won’t stop ‘til the light comes back, I’m comin’.
No more fear, just fire in my eyes,
Chasin′ shadows ‘til I touch the skies.

[Chorus]
Chasin’ shadows in the night,
I’ll find the way, I’ll make it right.
No more runnin’, no more fight,
I’m breakin′ free from this endless flight.
Yeah, chasin′ shadows in the night,
I’ll find the way, I’ll make it right.
No more runnin’, no more fight,
I’m breakin′ free from this endless flight.

[Bridge]
Shadows fade, I see the dawn,
I’ll keep movin’, I’ll stay strong.

[Verse 3]
I’ve been searchin’ for a way to break the chains,
But the road is long and filled with pain.
I’ll find my peace, I’ll find my light,
I’ll keep chasin’ shadows ‘til I get it right.

[Outro]
Chasin′ shadows, but I’m comin’ through…
I’ll find the light, I’ll make it true…
