[Verse 1]
The shadows rise, they twist and turn,
their weight a lesson I’ve yet to learn.
But deep inside, a spark ignites,
a fragile flame that burns through nights.

[Pre-Chorus]
Though the dark may try to claim my soul,
the sparks within make me whole.

[Chorus]
Shadows and sparks collide in me,
a war of light and symmetry.
In every fall, there’s fire to find,
a quiet strength I leave behind.

[Verse 2]
The night is loud with whispered fears,
but every dawn dissolves the tears.
The sparks grow brighter with every fight,
turning darkness into light.

[Bridge]
The shadows teach, the sparks inspire,
together they fuel my inner fire.
Even in chaos, I’ll still prevail,
for every shadow hides a trail.

[Final Section]
Shadows and sparks collide in me,
a war of light and symmetry.
In every fall, there’s fire to find,
a quiet strength I leave behind.
