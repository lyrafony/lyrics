[Intro]
Paper skies, torn at the seams,
Falling through my broken dreams.

[Verse]
Wings too fragile for this storm,
Dreams too heavy to transform.
Promises fold, promises break,
Still I reach, still I ache.

[Chorus]
Paper skies, crashing down,
All I built now hits the ground.
Hollow hopes and whispered cries,
Flying low through paper skies.

[Break]
Tear me apart, I wonâ€²t scream,
Lost in the folds of a dream.

[Verse]
Colors bleeding into gray,
Maps to nowhere guide my way.
Breathless runs through endless fields,
Trading truth for shattered shields.

[Chorus]
Paper skies, crashing down,
All I built now hits the ground.
Hollow hopes and whispered cries,
Flying low through paper skies.

[Outro]
Paper skies,
I still rise.
