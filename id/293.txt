[Verse 1]
I’ve walked a thousand miles alone,
Through deserts wide, through forests unknown.
The battle rages deep inside,
But I will fight, I will not hide.

[Pre-Chorus]
The road is long, but I won’t fall,
I hear the echoes of my call.
With every step, I’m closer still,
To the warrior’s path, I climb the hill.

[Chorus]
On this warrior’s path, I’ll never stray,
Through fire and storm, I’ll find my way.
The world may break, but I’ll stay strong,
In the warrior’s heart, I belong.

[Verse 2]
The night is dark, but I’ll find the light,
I’ll face my fears, I’ll win this fight.
With every scar, I’ll grow anew,
The warrior’s path will see me through.

[Pre-Chorus]
The road is long, but I won’t fall,
I hear the echoes of my call.
With every step, I’m closer still,
To the warrior’s path, I climb the hill.

[Chorus]
On this warrior’s path, I’ll never stray,
Through fire and storm, I’ll find my way.
The world may break, but I’ll stay strong,
In the warrior’s heart, I belong.

[Bridge]
With each new dawn, I rise again,
I’ll fight until I find the end.
No matter how the winds may blow,
The warrior’s heart will always grow.

[Chorus]
On this warrior’s path, I’ll never stray,
Through fire and storm, I’ll find my way.
The world may break, but I’ll stay strong,
In the warrior’s heart, I belong.
