[Verse 1]
We’re stuck in this storm, but we don’t see the rain
We’re fighting with words, but it’s all in vain
I keep asking myself, “Why do we hold on?”
When every time we’re close, it feels all wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
Our hearts are tangled, can’t we see?
The love we share’s both wild and free
But we keep fighting, can't find peace
I’m lost in you, but you’re lost in me

[Chorus]
Hearts in war, oh, can we ever find the way?
We’re stuck in this battle, fighting night and day
Hearts in war, should we keep pushing through?
Or do we surrender, baby, to me and you?

[Verse 2]
Your touch feels like fire, but it burns me inside
Every kiss is a battlefield where we collide
I’m trying to hold on, but you push me away
I don’t know if I should stay or stray

[Pre-Chorus]
Our hearts are tangled, can’t we see?
The love we share’s both wild and free
But we keep fighting, can't find peace
I’m lost in you, but you’re lost in me

[Chorus]
Hearts in war, oh, can we ever find the way?
We’re stuck in this battle, fighting night and day
Hearts in war, should we keep pushing through?
Or do we surrender, baby, to me and you?

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh, I don’t wanna lose this fight
But I’m tired of walking on broken light
Oh, oh, oh, should we stand or let it fall?
Or keep on fighting, after all?

[Chorus]
Hearts in war, oh, can we ever find the way?
We’re stuck in this battle, fighting night and day
Hearts in war, should we keep pushing through?
Or do we surrender, baby, to me and you?

[Outro]
Hearts in war, hearts in war, oh, oh, oh
I don’t wanna fight anymore,
But do we surrender? Do we fight some more?
