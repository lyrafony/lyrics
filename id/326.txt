[Verse]
I feel the fire burn deep inside,
A war I can’t escape, no place to hide.
My heart’s torn open, my soul’s a mess,
But in the chaos, I’ll find my strength, no less.

[Chorus]
Bleeding soul, but I’m still standing,
Through the storm, I’ll keep demanding.
Every scar’s a mark of pride,
In the pain, I’ll no longer hide.

[Verse]
The blood runs cold, but I’m alive,
In the ashes, I’ll survive.
My past is broken, my future unclear,
But I’m not afraid, I’m standing here.

[Chorus]
Bleeding soul, but I’m still standing,
Through the storm, I’ll keep demanding.
Every scar’s a mark of pride,
In the pain, I’ll no longer hide.

[Bridge]
I’ll rise from the ashes, burn it all,
Even if I stumble, I’ll never fall.
This bleeding heart can take the pain,
I’ll find the strength to break these chains.

[Chorus]
Bleeding soul, but I’m still standing,
Through the storm, I’ll keep demanding.
Every scar’s a mark of pride,
In the pain, I’ll no longer hide.

[Outro]
Bleeding soul, but I’m unbroken,
Through the fire, I’ve spoken.
