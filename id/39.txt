[Verse 1]
One day you’re fire, the next you’re cold
Some days you kiss me, some days you don’t
You say you miss me, then fade away
Should I stay or chase the flames?

[Pre-Chorus]
You wear a thousand faces, which one is true?
You’re a riddle I can’t undo
You pull me closer, then push me away
It’s a twisted game, but I wanna play

[Chorus]
A thousand versions of you, never know who to love
One moment you’re mine, then you’re just not enough
You change like the seasons, I can’t keep up
A thousand versions of you, is one ever enough?

[Verse 2]
One night you whisper, the next you scream
One day you’re golden, then you’re just a dream
I trace your shadows, try to hold on
But every time I do, you’re already gone

[Pre-Chorus]
You wear a thousand faces, which one is true?
You’re a riddle I can’t undo
You pull me closer, then push me away
It’s a twisted game, but I wanna play

[Chorus]
A thousand versions of you, never know who to love
One moment you’re mine, then you’re just not enough
You change like the seasons, I can’t keep up
A thousand versions of you, is one ever enough?

[Bridge]
Maybe I’m lost in your masquerade
Maybe I love the thrill of the chase
Maybe I’ll never know who you are
But maybe that’s what keeps me falling hard

[Outro]
A thousand versions of you, a mystery I can't solve
Maybe that's why I want it all...
