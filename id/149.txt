[Intro]
Can’t trust the words, can’t trust the smiles…

[Verse 1]
Handshakes cold, eyes full of doubt,
Loyalty’s a myth when the truth runs out.
Seen ‘em switch sides like the wind don’t stop,
Fake love thicker than the blood they drop.

[Chorus]
Bulletproof lies, dressed in gold,
Smiles so bright but the hearts stay cold.
Everyone’s real ‘til the tables turn,
Then the bridges light up and the past just burns.

[Verse 2]
Every man got a price, every bond got a crack,
Ain’t a soul in this city got your back.
Talk is cheap, but the cost runs high,
Trust the wrong face, now your luck runs dry.

[Pre-Chorus]
Move in silence, stay unseen,
Can’t play the game if you show what you mean.

[Chorus]
Bulletproof lies, dressed in gold,
Smiles so bright but the hearts stay cold.
Everyone’s real ‘til the tables turn,
Then the bridges light up and the past just burns.

[Bridge]
Nothing’s real but the weight of the steel,
Nothing lasts but the scars you feel.

[Verse 3]
Maybe I was raised to see through the smoke,
Maybe I was built to never lose hope.
Maybe the truth ain’t a thing you can hold,
Just another illusion they sell for the gold.

[Outro]
Can’t trust the words, can’t trust the smiles…
