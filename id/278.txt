Title: Falling Through the Cracks

[Verse 1]
Every step feels like a fall,
Gravity pulls, but I give it all.
Through the cracks, I see your face,
A fleeting glimpse, a haunting grace.

[Pre-Chorus]
Lost in the silence.
Can’t find my way back.

[Chorus]
Falling through the cracks,
Shadows pulling me down.
In the dark, I reach for you,
But you’re nowhere to be found.

[Verse 2]
The walls are closing in tonight,
No stars to guide, no saving light.
I’m breaking under the weight of us,
A love that crumbles to dust.

[Pre-Chorus]
Breathless.
Afraid to look back.

[Chorus]
Falling through the cracks,
Shadows pulling me down.
In the dark, I reach for you,
But you’re nowhere to be found.

[Bridge]
Maybe this is where we end,
Two souls too broken to mend.
The echoes fade, the silence grows,
A love unspoken, now it goes.

[Chorus]
Falling through the cracks,
Shadows pulling me down.
In the dark, I reach for you,
But you’re nowhere to be found.

[Outro]
Through the cracks, I disappear.
No one left to hear.
