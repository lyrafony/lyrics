[Verse 1]
Racing through the midnight glow,
City burns in undertow.
Faces flash like hollow ghosts,
Everyone just chasing smoke.

Wires hum beneath my skin,
Lost inside this world of tin.
Every step, another game,
But I refuse to play the same.

[Chorus]
Neon shadows, running fast,
Living now, forget the past.
No control, we cut the ties,
Tonight we burn, we light the sky.

[Verse 2]
Reflections twist, the glass is cracked,
What is real won’t take me back.
Silver tongues and empty stares,
Promises that go nowhere.

I see through the painted lies,
No more chains, no alibis.
If we’re fading, let’s ignite,
Set this place in flames tonight.

[Chorus]
Neon shadows, running fast,
Living now, forget the past.
No control, we cut the ties,
Tonight we burn, we light the sky.

[Bridge]
We don’t wait, we don’t break,
Push ahead, no give, just take.
One last move, one last fight,
We’ll make this city feel alive.

[Chorus]
Neon shadows, running fast,
Living now, forget the past.
No control, we cut the ties,
Tonight we burn, we light the sky.
