[Verse 1]
They told me to fit in, stay quiet, play nice,
But I’m not the type to roll the dice on their lies.
I wear my heart on my sleeve, it’s torn and frayed,
But I won’t change, no, I was born this way.

[Pre-Chorus]
So turn up the volume, let the speakers scream,
I’m done with the silence, I’ve got fire in my veins.
This is who I am, take it or leave,
I’m done playing games, I won’t break, I won’t kneel.

[Chorus]
We’re the misfits, the broken, the brave,
Dancing in the dark, unafraid of the flames.
Raise your voice, let it echo tonight,
This is our anthem, we’ll burn through the fight.
We’re the misfits, and we’ll never conform,
In this crazy world, we were born to storm.

[Verse 2]
The scars on my hands tell the stories I’ve lived,
Every bruise, every fall, every dream I’ve forgiv’.
They tried to box me in, but I broke all the seams,
Now I’m running wild with the outcasts and dreams.

[Pre-Chorus]
So crank up the bass, let the rhythm ignite,
We’re the kids in the shadows who stole back the light.
This is our time, we’re taking the lead,
No chains can hold us, we’re breaking free.

[Chorus]
We’re the misfits, the broken, the brave,
Dancing in the dark, unafraid of the flames.
Raise your voice, let it echo tonight,
This is our anthem, we’ll burn through the fight.
We’re the misfits, and we’ll never conform,
In this crazy world, we were born to storm.

[Bridge]
Oh, they can try to shut us down,
But we’ll rise like a hurricane in this town.
We’re louder than their rules, we’re stronger than their shame,
Together we’ll rewrite the game.

[Outro/Chorus]
We’re the misfits, the broken, the brave,
Dancing in the dark, unafraid of the flames.
Raise your voice, let it echo tonight,
This is our anthem, we’ll burn through the fight.
We’re the misfits, and we’ll never conform,
In this crazy world, we were born to storm.
