[Verse]
I’m fighting a war no one can see,
In the silence, it’s drowning me.
The weight of my thoughts, the pull of my mind,
In this quiet storm, I’m lost, I’m blind.

[Chorus]
The silent fight, I battle alone,
No one knows, I can’t atone.
In the shadows, I’ll stand my ground,
Even when there’s no sound.

[Verse]
Each day’s a struggle, each breath a war,
The echoes inside, I can’t ignore.
I carry the burden, I carry the pain,
Hoping the fight will end, but it remains.

[Chorus]
The silent fight, I battle alone,
No one knows, I can’t atone.
In the shadows, I’ll stand my ground,
Even when there’s no sound.

[Bridge]
I’ll keep pushing, I’ll keep moving on,
In the silence, I’m not gone.
The fight may rage, but I’ll survive,
In this battle, I’ll stay alive.

[Chorus]
The silent fight, I battle alone,
No one knows, I can’t atone.
In the shadows, I’ll stand my ground,
Even when there’s no sound.

[Outro]
The silent fight, but I’ll prevail,
Through the storm, I’ll set sail.
