[Intro]
Yeah, we break free tonight…
Ain’t no chains holdin′ me down.

[Verse 1]
I’ve been stuck in the shadows, lost in the fight,
But tonight’s the night I step into the light.
They tried to cage me, told me I was weak,
But I found my power, now I’m on my feet.

The walls they built, I’m breakin’ them down,
No more feelin’ trapped, I’m takin’ my crown.
Every battle I fought, it made me strong,
Now I’m movin′ forward, where I belong.

[Pre-Chorus]
I’m done with the chains, done with the lies,
I see the world now through open eyes.
No more holdin′ back, I’m settin′ my soul free,
It’s time to live the life that was meant for me.

[Chorus]
Ohhh, we gon’ break free,
No more chains, just you and me.
Ohhh, rise from the pain,
We gon’ break free, break the chain.

[Verse 2]
Every step I take, I’m stronger than before,
Told myself I’d make it, now I’m walkin’ through the door.
They tried to hold me down, but I got too far,
Now I’m leavin’ my mark like a shooting star.

The world tried to silence me, but I’m loud and clear,
I’m takin′ my freedom, I got no fear.
The past is behind me, I’m movin’ on,
Gonna keep goin′ till the break of dawn.

[Pre-Chorus]
I’m done with the chains, done with the lies,
I see the world now through open eyes.
No more holdin′ back, I’m settin′ my soul free,
It’s time to live the life that was meant for me.

[Chorus]
Ohhh, we gon’ break free,
No more chains, just you and me.
Ohhh, rise from the pain,
We gon’ break free, break the chain.

[Bridge]
The sky’s the limit, we’re takin′ flight,
No more fear, just endless night.

[Verse 3]
I’m breakin’ the rules, livin’ for today,
Gonna make it happen, no matter what they say.
The world’s my canvas, I’m paintin’ it bright,
Gonna rise above, I’m takin’ my flight.

[Outro]
Break free… from the chains,
We gon’ rise, break the pain…
