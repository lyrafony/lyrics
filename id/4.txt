[Verse 1]
Walking down the street, the city’s alive,
The world’s in motion, but we take our time,
A coffee in hand, the sun starts to climb,
Every step we take feels so sublime.

[Chorus]
City stroll, we’re just passing by,
No destination, we’re reaching for the sky,
The world’s a canvas, we’re painting it high,
City stroll, just you and I.

[Verse 2]
People around us, we’re all in sync,
Taking in the sights, no time to think,
The buzz of the city, it’s making us wink,
Every little corner, we stop and drink.

[Chorus]
City stroll, we’re just passing by,
No destination, we’re reaching for the sky,
The world’s a canvas, we’re painting it high,
City stroll, just you and I.

[Bridge]
No rush, no plan, just walking free,
Every block a new mystery,
The city’s heartbeat is our melody,
We’re living in this perfect harmony.

[Chorus]
City stroll, we’re just passing by,
No destination, we’re reaching for the sky,
The world’s a canvas, we’re painting it high,
City stroll, just you and I.

[Outro]
City stroll, we’ll keep on walking,
The world’s our stage, and we’re just talking,
City stroll, with no need for stopping,
We’re lost in the moment, forever rocking.
