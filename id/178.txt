[Intro – Spoken]
They built their towers, they wrote the rules.
They took the world and called it theirs.
But in the neon glow, we are awake.
And we are done waiting.

[Verse 1]
City lights, cold and blue,
Glass towers hide the chosen few.
We walk the streets, we hear the lies,
Numbers lost beneath the sky.

They built the walls, they locked the doors,
Kept us weak while they took more.
But there′s a spark, it starts to glow,
A rising fire they can’t control.

[Chorus]
Neon rebellion, light in the dark,
Burning brighter, striking sparks.
They can’t stop us, they won’t win,
A new world’s rising from within.

[Verse 2]
Every screen feeds their lies,
Synthetic gods in pixel skies.
But deep inside, we feel the pull,
A voice that says we’re powerful.

No more silence, no more chains,
No more playing their twisted game.
We were shadows, but now we rise,
Set the system alight tonight.

[Chorus]
Neon rebellion, light in the dark,
Burning brighter, striking sparks.
They can’t stop us, they won’t win,
A new world’s rising from within.

[Bridge]
Code is cracking, circuits fry,
They can′t stop the war inside.
We are thunder, we are fate,
We decide, it’s not too late.

[Chorus]
Neon rebellion, light in the dark,
Burning brighter, striking sparks.
They can’t stop us, they won’t win,
A new world’s rising from within.

[Outro – Spoken]
This is not the end.
This is the beginning.
We are the fire they feared.
