[Verse 1]
We meet at the café, early in the day,
With a cup in our hands, we’ve got time to stay,
Talking ‘bout life in the easiest way,
No rush, no stress, we’re here to play.

[Chorus]
Coffee and chatter, that’s all we need,
Laughing together, planting the seed,
No hurry, no worry, just good company,
Coffee and chatter, come and see.

[Verse 2]
The world keeps turning, but here we are,
No phones, no screens, just a coffee jar,
Stories to share, under the morning star,
Everything feels close, though we’re never far.

[Chorus]
Coffee and chatter, that’s all we need,
Laughing together, planting the seed,
No hurry, no worry, just good company,
Coffee and chatter, come and see.

[Bridge]
A little sugar, a little cream,
Our lives are simple, like a dream,
No need for answers, no need to scheme,
Just coffee and chatter, the perfect team.

[Chorus]
Coffee and chatter, that’s all we need,
Laughing together, planting the seed,
No hurry, no worry, just good company,
Coffee and chatter, come and see.

[Outro]
Coffee and chatter, the time goes slow,
With you by my side, there’s nowhere to go,
Coffee and chatter, just letting it flow,
We’ll keep on talking, ‘cause this feels like home.
