[Verse 1]
They handed me a crown made of whispers and lies,
Told me to wear it proud, but it never fit right.
The weight was too heavy, the edges too thin,
A fragile illusion I couldn’t live in.

[Pre-Chorus]
But I’m done with the masquerade, done with the show,
I’ll tear off this paper crown and let my true colors glow.
Every crack in the mirror, every scar on my skin,
Is proof that I’m more than the roles I’ve been in.

[Chorus]
Paper crowns, they crumble and fall,
Built on dreams that were never mine at all.
I’ll burn them to ash, let the embers ignite,
From the ruins, I’ll rise into my own light.

[Verse 2]
The throne was a shadow, the scepter a chain,
Bound by their rules, I was losing my name.
But now I see clearer, the truth sets me free,
No paper crown can ever define me.

[Pre-Chorus]
But I’m done with the masquerade, done with the show,
I’ll tear off this paper crown and let my true colors glow.
Every crack in the mirror, every scar on my skin,
Is proof that I’m more than the roles I’ve been in.

[Chorus]
Paper crowns, they crumble and fall,
Built on dreams that were never mine at all.
I’ll burn them to ash, let the embers ignite,
From the ruins, I’ll rise into my own light.

[Bridge]
Oh, they tried to mold me, shape me, confine,
But I’m breaking the chains, crossing their line.
This crown was a prison, but now I’m unstuck,
I’ll wear my own glory; it’s time to stand up.

[Final Section]
Paper crowns, they’re nothing but dust,
I’ve shed the illusions; now I trust.
In the fire of who I’m meant to be,
No paper crown can ever cage me.
