[Verse 1]
I walk the path where shadows fade,
A legacy, by blood, it’s made.
Through every trial, I’ve found my way,
The battle calls, I won’t delay.

[Pre-Chorus]
The fire burns, the ground it shakes,
A warrior’s pride is what it takes.
In every strike, in every breath,
I’ll face my fear, I’ll conquer death.

[Chorus]
This is my fight, this is my soul,
I am the one who’ll take control.
With every step, I’ll leave my mark,
A warrior’s pride, igniting the dark.

[Verse 2]
The storm may roar, the skies may tear,
But I’ll stand firm, I’ll never scare.
With every challenge, I rise again,
Stronger than ever, through the pain.

[Pre-Chorus]
The fire burns, the ground it shakes,
A warrior’s pride is what it takes.
In every strike, in every breath,
I’ll face my fear, I’ll conquer death.

[Chorus]
This is my fight, this is my soul,
I am the one who’ll take control.
With every step, I’ll leave my mark,
A warrior’s pride, igniting the dark.

[Bridge]
Through the blood and sweat I stand,
A legacy forged by my own hand.
No fear can break what’s deep inside,
I carry the fire, I wear the pride.

[Chorus]
This is my fight, this is my soul,
I am the one who’ll take control.
With every step, I’ll leave my mark,
A warrior’s pride, igniting the dark.
