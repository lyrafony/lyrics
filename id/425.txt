[Verse 1]
Behind closed doors, the secrets creep
Where shadows gather, silence keeps
A hidden game, a masked charade
Where trust is sold and hope betrayed

[Verse 2]
Words like arrows, sharp and cold
Stories twisted, lies retold
The crown’s true weight is cloaked in mist
A throne maintained with iron fist

[Chorus]
Secrets of thrones, the silent call
Echoes heard but seen by all
The mighty speak in veiled tones
But justice waits beyond the thrones

[Verse 3]
Though power plays in darkened rooms
There’s light beyond the veil of gloom
A voice that speaks without a sound
Where truth and mercy both are found

[Chorus]
Secrets of thrones, the silent call
Echoes heard but seen by all
The mighty speak in veiled tones
But justice waits beyond the thrones

[Bridge]
The night may hide the ruler’s face
But dawn will break, reveal the place
Where shadows fade and chains unwind
And truth at last will free the mind

[Final Chorus]
Secrets of thrones, the silent call
Echoes heard but seen by all
The mighty speak in veiled tones
But justice waits beyond the thrones
