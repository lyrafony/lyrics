Verse 1
I sent you a text, it’s been three whole days,
Three little dots, but you’re not fazed.
Are you busy? Or just a flake?
Decide now—my patience is fake.

Pre-Chorus
I’m not your mom, I’m not your friend,
I won’t wait forever for this to end.
So type your words or face the truth,
You’re running out of time, my dude.

Chorus
Text me back, or I’ll delete you,
I don’t have time for your debut.
Three dots appear, then fade away,
That’s not a game I want to play.
Text me back, or I’ll delete you,
This isn’t fun—it’s overdue.
Last chance to prove you’re worth my time,
Or you’re gone—I’m drawing the line.

Verse 2
I’ve got options, I’ve got plans,
I don’t need your disappearing acts.
Swipe left, block you, move ahead,
Your silence speaks louder than what you said.

Pre-Chorus
Tick-tock, hear the clock chime,
This is your final countdown time.
Reply now, or feel the sting,
I’m done waiting for anything.

Chorus
Text me back, or I’ll delete you,
I don’t have time for your debut.
Three dots appear, then fade away,
That’s not a game I want to play.
Text me back, or I’ll delete you,
This isn’t fun—it’s overdue.
Last chance to prove you’re worth my time,
Or you’re gone—I’m drawing the line.

Bridge
Maybe you’re scared, maybe you’re shy,
But silence won’t make me sit and sigh.
I’ve got better things to do,
Than wait around for someone like you.

Final Chorus (Outro)
Text me back, or I’ll delete you,
I don’t have time for your debut.
Three dots appear, then fade away,
That’s not a game I want to play.
Text me back, or I’ll delete you,
This isn’t fun—it’s overdue.
Last chance to prove you’re worth my time,
Or you’re gone—I’m drawing the line.

Drawing the line… yeah, I’m done tonight.
