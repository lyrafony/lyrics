[Intro]
I’ve seen dreams fall like rain from the sky,
But I still rise, I still reach for the high.

[Verse 1]
I’ve been down, felt the weight on my chest,
But I’m still standin′, still doin′ my best.
Chasin′ the real, no more chasin′ the fame,
I’m buildin′ my future, breakin’ the chains.

[Pre-Chorus]
Fallen dreams, they’re buried in the past,
But I’ll keep risin’ ‘til the very last.
The road’s been tough, but I’m standin′ tall,
I won’t let the dreams fall, I’ll catch ‘em all.

[Chorus]
Fallen dreams, but I still rise,
I’m reachin’ for the stars in the darkened skies.
Still movin’, won’t fall apart,
Even if the dreams fade, I’ll keep ‘em in my heart.
Yeah, fallen dreams, but I still rise,
I’m reachin’ for the stars in the darkened skies.
Still movin’, won’t fall apart,
Even if the dreams fade, I’ll keep ‘em in my heart.

[Verse 2]
I’ve seen the fall, but I’m back on my grind,
No more lookin′ back, I′m leavin′ the past behind.
It’s not about fame, it’s about stayin′ true,
I’m chasin′ my dreams, I got nothing to lose.

[Pre-Chorus]
Fallen dreams, they’re buried in the past,
But I’ll keep risin’ ‘til the very last.
The road’s been tough, but I’m standin′ tall,
I won’t let the dreams fall, I’ll catch ‘em all.

[Chorus]
Fallen dreams, but I still rise,
I’m reachin’ for the stars in the darkened skies.
Still movin’, won’t fall apart,
Even if the dreams fade, I’ll keep ‘em in my heart.
Yeah, fallen dreams, but I still rise,
I’m reachin’ for the stars in the darkened skies.
Still movin’, won’t fall apart,
Even if the dreams fade, I’ll keep ‘em in my heart.

[Bridge]
I’ll turn these fallen dreams into a fire,
I’ll fuel the flames, I’ll rise even higher.

[Verse 3]
The pain’s just a phase, I’m on the climb,
Every step I take, I’m runnin′ outta time.
I’ll rise from the ashes, I’ll break through the rain,
No matter the struggle, I’ll never feel the same.

[Outro]
Fallen dreams, but I’m still here…
Risin′ above, I’ve got no fear…
