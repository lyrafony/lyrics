[Verse 1]
In quiet corners of the night,
Your light remains, a soft delight.
Though shadows fall and time moves on,
Your glow is here — it lingers on.

[Verse 2]
A gentle warmth, a tender flame,
That calls my heart, recalls your name.
No distance dark, no fading hue,
Can dim the light that comes from you.

[Chorus]
The light that lingers in my soul,
A flame that keeps me whole.
Though days grow short and nights are long,
Your light remains — forever strong.

[Bridge]
Even when the world feels cold,
Your light is mine to hold.
A beacon shining through the years,
Dispelling all my fears.

[Outro]
In quiet corners of the night,
Your light remains, a soft delight.
