[Verse 1]
As the night fades, a new day’s born,
The light breaks through the darkest morn.
I’ve fought the shadows, now I stand,
With the dawn in my heart, and the world in my hands.

[Pre-Chorus]
Through the night, I’ve walked alone,
But now I rise, into the unknown.
The sun’s first light, it calls my name,
A new horizon, and I’m never the same.

[Chorus]
Eternal dawn, forever bright,
I’ll chase the day, I’ll fight the night.
With every step, I’ll find my way,
In the eternal dawn, I’ll rise today.

[Verse 2]
The past is gone, but I’ve learned to fight,
The scars I bear are the strength of light.
With every breath, I feel alive,
In the eternal dawn, I’ll thrive.

[Pre-Chorus]
Through the night, I’ve walked alone,
But now I rise, into the unknown.
The sun’s first light, it calls my name,
A new horizon, and I’m never the same.

[Chorus]
Eternal dawn, forever bright,
I’ll chase the day, I’ll fight the night.
With every step, I’ll find my way,
In the eternal dawn, I’ll rise today.

[Bridge]
No more shadows, no more fear,
With every sunrise, I’m drawing near.
The light will guide me, every day,
In the eternal dawn, I’ll find my way.

[Chorus]
Eternal dawn, forever bright,
I’ll chase the day, I’ll fight the night.
With every step, I’ll find my way,
In the eternal dawn, I’ll rise today.
