[Verse 1]
I saw the sky break open wide
The ocean roared, the wind defied
I braced for waves to take me down
But somehow I didn’t drown

[Verse 2]
My faith was thin, my hope was torn
My hands were shaking, cold and worn
No lifeboat came, no rescue cry
Just silence keeping me alive

[Chorus]
I should’ve sunk, I should’ve slipped
Beneath the weight I couldn’t lift
But something stronger held me tight
Without a voice, without a light
I faced the dark, the fury free
But the storm didn’t drown me

[Verse 3]
I screamed at shadows, begged for signs
The thunder answered every time
Still through the chaos, breath by breath
Something stood between me and death

[Chorus]
I should’ve sunk, I should’ve slipped
Beneath the weight I couldn’t lift
But something stronger held me tight
Without a voice, without a light
I faced the dark, the fury free
But the storm didn’t drown me

[Bridge]
It wasn’t strength, it wasn’t will
I broke, and I am breaking still
But peace appeared with no demand
Like calm that waits with open hands

[Final Chorus]
I should’ve sunk, but here I stand
No answers written in the sand
Just footprints where I cannot see
That the storm didn’t drown me
No, the storm didn’t drown me
