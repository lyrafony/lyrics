[Verse 1]
Though the fire fades, it still remains,
A flicker deep within my veins.
Forbidden desires will always call,
An eternal flame that won’t burn small.

[Pre-Chorus]
Every heartbeat keeps it alive,
A secret love that will survive.
No matter how far we drift apart,
This flame burns bright in my heart.

[Chorus]
Eternal flame, it never dies,
A spark that lights the darkest skies.
Through shadows deep and endless night,
You’re the fire, my guiding light.

[Verse 2]
The world may try to dim our glow,
But they’ll never truly know.
The bond we share, the love we made,
A fire no force can ever fade.

[Pre-Chorus]
Every heartbeat keeps it alive,
A secret love that will survive.
No matter how far we drift apart,
This flame burns bright in my heart.

[Chorus]
Eternal flame, it never dies,
A spark that lights the darkest skies.
Through shadows deep and endless night,
You’re the fire, my guiding light.

[Bridge]
Even when the embers turn cold,
Our story will forever hold.
In every whisper, in every sigh,
The flame of us will never die.

[Chorus]
Eternal flame, it never dies,
A spark that lights the darkest skies.
Through shadows deep and endless night,
You’re the fire, my guiding light.

[Outro]
Eternal flame, forever you’ll stay,
A love unbound by time’s decay.
In the silence, I hear your name,
A burning echo, an eternal flame.
