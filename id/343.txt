[Verse 1]
The signal fades, the lights go dim,
I search for answers, but they’re thin.
The air is cold, the silence loud,
I’m drowning in a fractured crowd.

[Pre-Chorus]
I try to reach, but I can’t connect,
A broken line, I can’t correct.
The signal’s gone, I’ve lost the way,
I’m lost inside the endless gray.

[Chorus]
Fading signal, can’t you hear?
The world is slipping, disappear.
I’ll scream, I’ll shout, I’ll break the chain,
But the signal’s fading, it’s all in vain.

[Verse 2]
The screen is black, the lines are crossed,
I try to hold, but I am lost.
The world is silent, the echoes freeze,
A fading signal, a life on its knees.

[Bridge]
The darkness grows, I feel the fall,
The signal’s gone, I hear no call.
I’ll fight the silence, fight the night,
But the signal fades, out of sight.

[Chorus]
Fading signal, can’t you hear?
The world is slipping, disappear.
I’ll scream, I’ll shout, I’ll break the chain,
But the signal’s fading, it’s all in vain.

[Outro]
The signal fades, but I’ll stand tall,
I’ll find the strength, I’ll break the fall.
A new frequency, I’ll tune the line,
A fading signal, but I’ll be fine.
