[Verse 1]
I’ve been chasing shadows of who I thought I’d be,
A stranger staring back from the mirror haunting me.
Lost in expectations, tangled in disguise,
I barely recognize my own eyes.
The noise outside drowned out my voice,
Now silence calls, it’s time to make a choice.
To peel away the layers I’ve worn so tight,
And rediscover the soul that shines so bright.

[Pre-Chorus]
It’s hard to face the person you left behind,
To sift through pieces scattered over time.
But every step toward self-reclaiming,
Brings closer the life worth sustaining.

[Chorus]
I’ll find myself again, beneath the weight,
Unravel truths I tried to negate.
Through every doubt, through every fear,
The real me emerges, finally near.
With every breath, I’ll strip away the lies,
Rebuild the dreams that never truly died.
This is my journey, my sacred quest,
To reunite with the heart I love the best.

[Verse 2]
I wandered far, convinced I had to prove,
That worth was tied to choices others approve.
But now I hear a quiet song,
A melody where I belong.
The road feels long, the path unclear,
Yet something pulls me forward here.
Each misstep taught me how to grow,
To trust the rhythm only I know.

[Pre-Chorus]
It’s hard to face the person you left behind,
To sift through pieces scattered over time.
But every step toward self-reclaiming,
Brings closer the life worth sustaining.

[Chorus]
I’ll find myself again, beneath the weight,
Unravel truths I tried to negate.
Through every doubt, through every fear,
The real me emerges, finally near.
With every breath, I’ll strip away the lies,
Rebuild the dreams that never truly died.
This is my journey, my sacred quest,
To reunite with the heart I love the best.
