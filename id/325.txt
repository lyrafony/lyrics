[Verse]
I’ve walked through the fire, felt the burn,
Each scar a lesson I’ve had to learn.
The ashes rise, but so do I,
From the rubble, I’ll spread my wings and fly.

[Chorus]
Through the ashes, I will rise,
From the flames, I’ll touch the skies.
The past may burn, but I’ll be strong,
In the ashes, I belong.

[Verse]
The world may crumble, the earth may shake,
But I’ll rebuild, no matter the stake.
With every fall, I’ll find my feet,
Through the ashes, I’ll feel complete.

[Chorus]
Through the ashes, I will rise,
From the flames, I’ll touch the skies.
The past may burn, but I’ll be strong,
In the ashes, I belong.

[Bridge]
The fire may rage, the storm may roar,
But I’ll stand tall, I’ll ask for more.
Through the pain, through the night,
I’ll find my way to the light.

[Chorus]
Through the ashes, I will rise,
From the flames, I’ll touch the skies.
The past may burn, but I’ll be strong,
In the ashes, I belong.

[Outro]
Through the ashes, I’ve become whole,
In the fire, I’ve found my soul.
