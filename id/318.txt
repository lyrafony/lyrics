[Verse]
The tears fall quietly in the night,
A silent cry, no end in sight.
In the stillness, I feel the weight,
A heart that mourns, a soul that’s late.

[Chorus]
Tears in the silence, they speak to me,
Of all the pain I cannot see.
In this void, I try to find,
A piece of peace, a place to hide.

[Verse]
Each tear a story left untold,
A shattered heart that’s grown so cold.
I seek the warmth, but none is near,
In the silence, I face my fear.

[Chorus]
Tears in the silence, they speak to me,
Of all the pain I cannot see.
In this void, I try to find,
A piece of peace, a place to hide.

[Bridge]
But even in the darkest night,
I’ll learn to stand, I’ll find the light.
The tears may fall, but they’ll dry in time,
In the silence, I’ll start to climb.

[Chorus]
Tears in the silence, they speak to me,
Of all the pain I cannot see.
In this void, I try to find,
A piece of peace, a place to hide.

[Outro]
And when the silence fades away,
I’ll carry the tears, but I’ll be okay.
