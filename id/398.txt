[Verse 1]
Kneeling down on frozen stone
Words recited, hearts alone
Fervent acts without a flame
Empty rituals, hollow claim

[Verse 2]
Chants repeated, voices rise
Yet passion’s spark has long since died
A worship wrapped in icy veil
Where love and truth begin to fail

[Chorus]
Cold altar, silent cries
Fading faith and whispered lies
Hands held high but hearts apart
Empty worship, fractured heart

[Verse 3]
No warmth flows from prayers made
Just cold winds and shadows’ shade
The soul cries out beneath the frost
For love and grace, not empty cost

[Chorus]
Cold altar, silent cries
Fading faith and whispered lies
Hands held high but hearts apart
Empty worship, fractured heart

[Bridge]
Let fire burn and walls dissolve
True devotion to evolve
From cold rituals, break away
And find the dawn of genuine day

[Final Chorus]
Cold altar, silent cries
Fading faith and whispered lies
Hands held high but hearts apart
Empty worship, fractured heart
