[Verse 1]
The ocean's calling, let's take a ride,
Sandy toes, and the waves collide,
Feel the rhythm of the tide,
Everything we need is by our side.

[Chorus]
Relax on the beach, let it flow,
The sun is shining, let it show,
Good vibes only, that's the way to go,
With the sea breeze, we’re taking it slow.

[Verse 2]
Friends are laughing, drinks in hand,
Laying down on the soft white sand,
No stress, just where we stand,
Together, feeling like we planned.

[Chorus]
Relax on the beach, let it flow,
The sun is shining, let it show,
Good vibes only, that's the way to go,
With the sea breeze, we’re taking it slow.

[Bridge]
The world fades away, it's just you and me,
Under the palm trees, where we’re meant to be,
No rush, just let it be,
Relaxing on the beach, feeling free.

[Chorus]
Relax on the beach, let it flow,
The sun is shining, let it show,
Good vibes only, that's the way to go,
With the sea breeze, we’re taking it slow.

[Outro]
Relax on the beach, feel the sound,
Where the ocean meets the ground,
Let the waves spin us around,
On this beach, we’re truly found.
