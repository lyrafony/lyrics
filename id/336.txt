Title: Lost in the Simulation

[Verse]
I wander through the endless maze,
A world that’s fake, a mind that strays.
The walls are closing, I can’t break free,
Trapped in this place, it’s swallowing me.

[Chorus]
Lost in the simulation, can’t you see?
A life controlled, but it’s not me.
The chains are tight, I can’t escape,
I’m lost in the simulation, a hollow state.

[Verse]
The days repeat, the nights are long,
I sing the same old, empty song.
The world is fake, it’s all been planned,
I’m just a puppet with no hand.

[Chorus]
Lost in the simulation, can’t you see?
A life controlled, but it’s not me.
The chains are tight, I can’t escape,
I’m lost in the simulation, a hollow state.

[Bridge]
The data runs, but I don’t feel,
It’s all a lie, none of this is real.
I scream inside, but no one hears,
A prisoner of my darkest fears.

[Chorus]
Lost in the simulation, can’t you see?
A life controlled, but it’s not me.
The chains are tight, I can’t escape,
I’m lost in the simulation, a hollow state.

[Outro]
I’ll break the chains or fade away,
But for now, I’m lost, I can’t break the play.
