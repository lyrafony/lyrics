[Verse]
The echoes fade, they slip away,
Like whispers in the dark of day.
I hear the voices, soft and clear,
But they vanish as I draw near.

[Chorus]
Fading echoes, calling me,
Lost in the sound of what used to be.
They linger in my soul, but they’re gone,
A fading song, a broken dawn.

[Verse]
The past is distant, yet it stays,
A haunting shadow, a lost maze.
I reach for the fragments in the air,
But nothing is left, just despair.

[Chorus]
Fading echoes, calling me,
Lost in the sound of what used to be.
They linger in my soul, but they’re gone,
A fading song, a broken dawn.

[Bridge]
I let them go, the echoes fade,
But in their silence, I’ve been made.
From the loss, I find my way,
The echoes taught me how to stay.

[Chorus]
Fading echoes, calling me,
Lost in the sound of what used to be.
They linger in my soul, but they’re gone,
A fading song, a broken dawn.

[Outro]
And though they fade, I’ll carry on,
Fading echoes, but I’m not gone.
