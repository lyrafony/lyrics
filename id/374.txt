[Verse 1]
Not bound by days, nor chains of years
A pulse that calms our deepest fears
Beyond the veil of time and space
A sacred breath, a lasting grace

[Verse 2]
When shadows fall and bodies fade
A spark remains, will not degrade
No end, no loss, no final breath
A life that dances past the death

[Chorus]
Life that transcends, beyond the end
A flame that breaks, will never bend
Not caught in time, not held by fear
An endless song we always hear

[Verse 3]
The dawn that never meets the dusk
A force that flows through all of us
Invisible yet always near
The whisper that we choose to hear

[Chorus]
Life that transcends, beyond the end
A flame that breaks, will never bend
Not caught in time, not held by fear
An endless song we always hear

[Bridge]
Though bodies fail and voices cease
This life persists in quiet peace
A sacred spark that lights the way
Forevermore, a brighter day

[Final Chorus]
Life that transcends, beyond the end
A flame that breaks, will never bend
Not caught in time, not held by fear
An endless song we always hear
