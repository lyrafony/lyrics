[Verse 1]
You walked away, no turning back,
Leaving behind all we used to have.
I hear your footsteps, but they fade,
Like a memory I can’t erase.
Your words still linger in the air,
But now they’re just whispers of despair.

[Chorus]
Echoes of goodbye, they haunt my mind,
A love once bright, now hard to find.
I’m lost in the silence, drowning in tears,
Wishing you were still here, but you′re not near.
Echoes of goodbye, they won’t let go,
I’m stuck in the past, caught in the flow.

[Verse 2]
I reach for you, but you’re not there,
A ghost of love, hanging in the air.
The promises we made have turned to dust,
And now I’m left with nothing but rust.
I keep waiting, but time moves on,
The echoes grow louder, but you’re gone.

[Chorus]
Echoes of goodbye, they haunt my mind,
A love once bright, now hard to find.
I’m lost in the silence, drowning in tears,
Wishing you were still here, but you′re not near.
Echoes of goodbye, they won’t let go,
I’m stuck in the past, caught in the flow.

[Outro]
Echoes of goodbye, fading away,
But I’ll remember you every day.
A love that once shone, now dimmed by time,
Your echoes are all I have left to find.
