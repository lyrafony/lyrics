Title: Lost Signals

[Intro]
Faint echoes through the static waves...

[Verse 1]
Neon signs flicker down these empty streets,
Messages lost in the space between.
Tryna hold on, but the signal fades,
Drowning in the noise of a world that’s changed.

[Chorus]
Can you hear me? Am I gone?
Lost in frequencies too far beyond.
Fading out, breaking in,
Searching for a voice in the air so thin.

[Verse 2]
Late-night calls that never go through,
Words unsaid, left without a clue.
Every line’s busy, every bridge burned,
Reaching for a past that won’t return.

[Pre-Chorus]
No response, no rewind,
Just a voice lost in time.

[Chorus]
Can you hear me? Am I gone?
Lost in frequencies too far beyond.
Fading out, breaking in,
Searching for a voice in the air so thin.

[Bridge]
Screens glow bright, but the room stays cold,
Truth gets lost in the stories told.

[Verse 3]
Maybe we were never meant to connect,
Maybe we’re just echoes in the disconnect.
Or maybe the waves still carry my name,
Waiting for someone to hear it again.

[Outro]
Faint echoes through the static waves...
