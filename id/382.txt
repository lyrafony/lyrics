[Verse 1]
No flash of light, no roaring flame
No voice that called me out by name
Just morning air and trembling hands
And something new I understand

[Verse 2]
No ceremony marked the change
No crowd, no sign, no altar stage
Just quiet steps on softened ground
Where broken hearts start healing sound

[Chorus]
Silent renewal, calm and slow
It starts in places no one knows
No need to prove, no need to show
Just roots that drink and slowly grow

[Verse 3]
The world may look and never see
The turning tides inside of me
But I have felt the shift begin
A fire wrapped in quiet skin

[Chorus]
Silent renewal, calm and slow
It starts in places no one knows
No need to prove, no need to show
Just roots that drink and slowly grow

[Bridge]
Let others chase the flash and sound
I’ve found new life beneath the ground
Where stillness speaks and grace descends
And healing takes the time it spends

[Final Chorus]
Silent renewal, true and deep
It stirs the soul the world can’t keep
It doesn’t shout, it doesn’t shine
But it remakes this life of mine
