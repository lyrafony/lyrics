[Verse]
I saw you from a distance, your eyes like the sun,
Every word you spoke made my heart come undone,
I thought you felt the same, that we were meant to be,
But deep down I felt something was missing in me.

[Verse]
I got lost in your smiles, in the way you’d walk,
Every time we spoke, I struggled not to talk,
I hoped that when you looked, you'd see what I had to give,
But when you left, my soul struggled to live.

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe you never knew, or maybe I never saw,
All my love was wasted, while I kept holding on.

[Chorus]
I wasn't what you wanted, I wasn't what you needed,
But loving you was the only truth I believed,
I gave it all without doubt, with no fear to fall,
And though my love was real, you never saw it at all.

[Verse]
The nights felt so long, waiting for a sign,
Every time you came close, I felt something divine,
But your eyes never saw me in that special way,
And my hope would fade a little more every day.

[Verse]
Sometimes I wonder if in your heart there was a space,
Where maybe my name could have found its place,
But in the end, love isn't something you can force,
And I know now, I can't keep holding on, of course.

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe you never knew, or maybe I never saw,
All my love was wasted, while I kept holding on.

[Chorus]
I wasn't what you wanted, I wasn't what you needed,
But loving you was the only truth I believed,
I gave it all without doubt, with no fear to fall,
And though my love was real, you never saw it at all.
