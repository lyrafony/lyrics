[Verse 1]
Stretching far beyond the sound,
Velvet skies are spinning round.
Whispers melt into the floor,
Craving rhythm, craving more.

[Chorus]
Velvet horizon, pull me in,
Past the noise, past the spin.
Velvet horizon, soft and wide,
Where the music learns to glide.

[Verse 2]
Neon rivers bend and flow,
Painting dreams in undertow.
Every step a soft escape,
Velvet horizon shapes my fate.

[Chorus]
Velvet horizon, pull me in,
Past the noise, past the spin.
Velvet horizon, soft and wide,
Where the music learns to glide.

[Bridge]
Nothing matters, nothing stays,
Velvet winds will guide our ways.
Dance until the morning calls,
Chasing velvet through the halls.

[Chorus]
Velvet horizon, pull me in,
Past the noise, past the spin.
Velvet horizon, soft and wide,
Where the music learns to glide.

[Outro]
Velvet horizon...
Glide away...
