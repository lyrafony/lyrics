[Intro]
Yeah, we rise up tonight...
No more ghosts pullin’ me down.

[Verse 1]
Used to run in circles, lost in my mind,
Trapped in the dark, no way to rewind.
They told me “stay quiet,” follow the line,
But I broke through the chains, now I take what’s mine.

Left behind the fear, left behind the past,
Ain’t no lookin’ back, I’m movin’ too fast.
Scars on my soul, but they made me strong,
Now I stand tall where I belong.

[Pre-Chorus]
I’m done with the doubt, done with the pain,
Feelin’ the fire burn in my veins.
No more runnin’ scared, I’m takin’ control,
This is my story, I’m ready to go.

[Chorus]
Ohhh, we ain’t lookin’ back,
No more chains, we’re on the attack.
Ohhh, stand in the fire,
Rise from the ashes, climbin’ higher.

[Verse 2]
Every step I take, the shadows fade,
I found my voice, now I’m unafraid.
They tried to stop me, tried to erase,
But I left my mark, now they know my name.

No regrets, no time to stall,
Breakin’ the limits, I’m takin’ it all.
They said I’d never reach this place,
But here I am, now watch me blaze.

[Pre-Chorus]
I’m done with the doubt, done with the pain,
Feelin’ the fire burn in my veins.
No more runnin’ scared, I’m takin’ control,
This is my story, I’m ready to go.

[Chorus]
Ohhh, we ain’t lookin’ back,
No more chains, we’re on the attack.
Ohhh, stand in the fire,
Rise from the ashes, climbin’ higher.

[Bridge]
No more whispers, no more fear,
I see the light, it’s crystal clear.

[Verse 3]
I’m runnin’ fast, no turnin’ around,
No more silence, I’m hearin’ the sound.
Life’s a battle, but I made it through,
Now the road is open, it’s mine to choose.

[Outro]
No more shadows, no more chains,
We gon’ rise, break the pain...
