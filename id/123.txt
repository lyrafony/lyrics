[Verse 1]
Engine’s roaring, streets are wild,
burning rubber, running miles.
No regrets, no looking back,
side by side, we own the track.

[Pre-Chorus]
Through the fire, through the storm,
we don’t bend, we’re battle-worn.
Heartbeats racing, wind so high,
it’s you and me till the end of time!

[Chorus]
Ride or die, through the night,
blazing fast under neon lights.
No slowing down, no goodbye,
we’re forever, ride or die!

[Verse 2]
We got scars, we wear ‘em proud,
screaming loud, we own this crowd.
No more fears, no second guess,
we were born to chase the crest!

[Pre-Chorus]
Through the fire, through the storm,
we don’t bend, we’re battle-worn.
Heartbeats racing, wind so high,
it’s you and me till the end of time!

[Chorus]
Ride or die, through the night,
blazing fast under neon lights.
No slowing down, no goodbye,
we’re forever, ride or die!

[Bridge]
Even if the road gets rough,
even if the stars burn out,
we’ll keep riding, no defeat,
we are fire, we are speed!

[Final Chorus]
Ride or die, through the night,
blazing fast under neon lights.
No slowing down, no goodbye,
we’re forever, ride or die!
