[Intro]
Another day, another scroll... but some dreams fade away...

[Verse 1]
Screen glow hittin’ like a midnight flame,
Chasin’ all these numbers but they never know my name.
We was young, we was real, now it’s all for show,
Tryna paint a perfect life but the cracks still grow.

Swiping through the past like a highlight reel,
Every frame lookin’ golden but it ain’t that real.
Lost in the feed, tryna chase what’s next,
But the moment don’t last, just a ghost in the text.

[Pre-Chorus]
City lights shine, but my mind fade out,
Lost between the noise and the digital doubt.
Tryna find a reason in a world so fake,
Tryna find myself but my soul still aches.

[Chorus]
Ohhh, tell me where the time go,
Scrollin’ but the days move slow.
Ohhh, lost between the highs and lows,
Livin’ in the screen but it don’t show the road.

[Verse 2]
Reflections in the lens, filter keep it clean,
But the weight on my chest ain′t a part of the scene.
Seen a friend turn ghost, tryna chase that fame,
Now he trapped in the views, but he lost his name.

Every like, every heart, just a hit, just a dose,
But it fade so quick, leave you cold like a ghost.
What’s the price of a dream when it’s built on lies?
What’s the worth of a throne when it’s all disguised?

[Pre-Chorus]
City lights shine, but my mind fade out,
Lost between the noise and the digital doubt.
Tryna find a reason in a world so fake,
Tryna find myself but my soul still aches.

[Chorus]
Ohhh, tell me where the time go,
Scrollin’ but the days move slow.
Ohhh, lost between the highs and lows,
Livin’ in the screen but it don’t show the road.

[Bridge]
I see shadows of my past...
I hear echoes through the glass...

[Verse 3]
Maybe life ain’t measured in the clicks or the fame,
Maybe all we chasin’ just a part of the game.
Maybe all the answers were here all along,
Not in pictures, not in posts, but the words of a song.

[Outro]
Screen lights... shining bright... but they never show the way...
