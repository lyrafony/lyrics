[Verse 1]
I hear them calling, soft whispers in the night,
Fragments of a story I thought I’d left behind.
Every step I take, they follow like a shadow,
Echoes of the soul, reflections of my past.

The weight of yesterday still lingers in my chest,
But in the silence, I find a quiet strength.
These scars that bind me, they’re breaking one by one,
Each echo fades away, revealing who I’ve become.

[Chorus]
Echoes of the soul, they guide me through the dark,
A symphony of memories etched into my heart.
Though the pain still lingers, it’s teaching me to grow,
In every echo, I find a piece of my own glow.

[Verse 2]
Through neon lights and endless roads, I wander free,
Searching for the answers buried deep in me.
The echoes tell a tale of love, of loss, of dreams,
Of battles fought and won, and rivers crossed between.

They whisper softly, ″You’re stronger than you know,″
Even when the world feels heavy, even when it’s cold.
The echoes fade, but their lessons stay with me,
A map to guide my journey, to set my spirit free.

[Chorus]
Echoes of the soul, they guide me through the dark,
A symphony of memories etched into my heart.
Though the pain still lingers, it’s teaching me to grow,
In every echo, I find a piece of my own glow.

[Bridge]
Neon fades, the night gives way to dawn,
Every shadow hides a truth where light is born.
I’m not afraid to face what lies within,
For in the echoes, I rediscover where I’ve been.

[Outro]
Echoes of the soul, they’ll never truly die,
They’re the threads that weave my story, they’re the reasons why.
I walk this path, no longer bound by fear,
The echoes guide me forward, they’ve brought me here.
