[Verse 1]
A breath between us, soft and slow,
The quiet space where feelings grow.
No words spoken, yet understood,
In that stillness, all is good.

[Verse 2]
Your eyes meet mine, the world fades,
A gentle calm that never fades.
Between the moments, pure and true,
I find my home, I find you.

[Chorus]
In every breath, in every space,
I see your light, I feel your grace.
No need to chase, no need to run,
Our souls align â€” become as one.

[Bridge]
Between the silence and the sound,
In that small space where hearts are bound.
A breath, a pause, a fleeting touch,
I need no more, I need not much.

[Outro]
A breath between us, soft and deep,
A place where love and peace both keep.
