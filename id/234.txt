[Verse]
The beat is calling, it’s in my veins,
A rhythm born of electric flames.
I feel the rush, the endless drive,
This is where I come alive.

[Chorus]
Feel the pulse of the night take hold,
Every step a story told.
We’re chasing stars, we’re breaking free,
This is who we’re meant to be.

[Verse]
The city glows with neon light,
A dance of shadows in the night.
No fear, no end, just pure release,
The music fuels our inner peace.

[Bridge]
Ohhh… ohhh…
Riding waves of sound and time…
Ohhh… ohhh…
Losing self in the climb…

[Outro]
We move as one, we feel the fire,
Higher and higher, taking us higher.
In every beat, in every sound,
Forever lost, forever found.
