[Intro]
Once whole, now broken, lost in despair,
The pieces scattered, no one to care.
I gave you all, I gave you trust,
But now I’m left, consumed by dust.

[Verso 1]
You took my strength, you took my mind,
Now all that’s left is what’s been left behind.
You tore me apart, you broke my core,
Leaving me empty, nothing more.

[Pre-Coro]
I thought you were different, I thought you were true,
But now I see the real you.
The lies you fed, the pain you gave,
Left me broken, trapped in a grave.

[Coro]
Shattered soul, can’t feel a thing,
The emptiness is all it brings.
You took it all, you left me cold,
A hollow heart, a broken soul.

[Verso 2]
I reach for peace, I reach for light,
But every step pulls me deeper into night.
The damage is done, the wound won’t heal,
A shattered soul, I can’t feel.

[Puente]
The darkness calls, it feels like home,
I’m lost in this, forever alone.
You left your mark, you left your scar,
Now I’m drifting, so far, so far.

[Coro]
Shattered soul, can’t feel a thing,
The emptiness is all it brings.
You took it all, you left me cold,
A hollow heart, a broken soul.
