[Verse 1]
In the quiet where doubts reside
A whisper moves, a gentle guide
Not loud or clear, but soft and near
A voice that only I can hear

[Verse 2]
It speaks in tones both calm and slow
Through tangled paths where questions grow
A subtle light behind the veil
A promise whispered through the pale

[Chorus]
Whispers in the shadow, soft and low
Leading where the lost can go
Though silence seems to hold the sway
These whispers guide the uncertain way

[Verse 3]
No crowd to cheer, no shining crown
Just quiet steps where hopes are found
A secret strength, a hidden flame
That calls me gently by no name

[Chorus]
Whispers in the shadow, soft and low
Leading where the lost can go
Though silence seems to hold the sway
These whispers guide the uncertain way

[Bridge]
When doubts surround and fears arise
I listen close beyond the lies
For in the hush, the truth is found
In whispered love without a sound

[Final Chorus]
Whispers in the shadow, soft and low
Leading where the lost can go
Though silence seems to hold the sway
These whispers guide the uncertain way
