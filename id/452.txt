[Verse 1]
I should have fallen long ago
Crumbled under every blow
The weight too heavy, the nights too cold
But here I am, still holding hold

[Verse 2]
The road was dark, the end unclear
I walked through doubt, I faced the fear
No answers came, no helping hand
Just silent strength I don’t understand

[Chorus]
Still standing, and I don’t know why
Against the odds, beneath the sky
Though broken, bruised, and battle-scarred
There’s something holding, something hard
Not in me, but close and near
Still standing, despite the fear

[Verse 3]
I’ve lost my way, forgot my song
But something steady kept me strong
No spotlight here, no victory cry
Just quiet grace that won’t say goodbye

[Chorus]
Still standing, and I don’t know why
Against the odds, beneath the sky
Though broken, bruised, and battle-scarred
There’s something holding, something hard
Not in me, but close and near
Still standing, despite the fear

[Bridge]
When all seemed lost, when hope withdrew
That hidden hand pulled me through
I don’t know why, but here I stand
A broken soul held by a hand

[Final Chorus]
Still standing, and I don’t know why
Against the odds, beneath the sky
Though broken, bruised, and battle-scarred
There’s something holding, something hard
Not in me, but close and near
Still standing, despite the fear
