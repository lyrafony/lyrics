[Verse 1]
Through the code, I hunt them down,
Tracking ghosts in the underground.
I see your move, I know your name,
In this game, it’s all the same.

Chasing shadows, eyes on the screen,
In the void, I’m always seen.
They run, but they can’t escape,
In this world, I control their fate.

[Chorus]
Cyber hunt, it’s in my veins,
Hacking hearts, breaking chains.
No retreat, no surrender,
I’ll find you, now or never.

[Verse 2]
No matter where you try to hide,
I’m right behind, I will collide.
Electric thoughts, my mind’s a storm,
In this digital world, I’m reborn.

No firewall can stop my will,
I’ll break through, I’ll climb the hill.
I’m the shadow in the code,
And I’ll never leave your mode.

[Chorus]
Cyber hunt, it’s in my veins,
Hacking hearts, breaking chains.
No retreat, no surrender,
I’ll find you, now or never.

[Bridge]
Chase the dark, chase the light,
Through the screen, into the night.
One last move, I’ll seal your fate,
In this game, you can’t escape.

[Chorus]
Cyber hunt, it’s in my veins,
Hacking hearts, breaking chains.
No retreat, no surrender,
I’ll find you, now or never.
