[Intro]
Heavy heart, and broken dreams,
Tied to the past by invisible seams,
Every step I take, I feel the weight,
The chains I forged in my own fate.

[Verso 1]
I’ve walked this path, with blood-stained hands,
Held onto mistakes I can’t withstand.
Every word I spoke, a knife in the dark,
Now I’m left with the scars, a permanent mark.

[Pre-Coro]
The chains pull tight, they drag me down,
Can’t escape the burden that I’ve found.
Regret’s a shackle, it won’t let me go,
I carry it with me, everywhere I go.

[Coro]
Chains of regret, wrapped around my soul,
Holding me captive, taking its toll.
I can’t break free from this endless fight,
The chains of regret keep me up at night.

[Verso 2]
I’ve tried to move on, to heal and forget,
But every wrong turn brings more regret.
The past is a shadow that I can’t outrun,
Every day I wonder what I’ve become.

[Puente]
I’ve been broken, I’ve been lost,
Fighting demons at any cost.
But no matter how hard I try to rise,
I’m always held back by my own lies.

[Coro]
Chains of regret, wrapped around my soul,
Holding me captive, taking its toll.
I can’t break free from this endless fight,
The chains of regret keep me up at night.
