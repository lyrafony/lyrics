[Verse 1]
The sun is setting, painting the sky,
Colors of gold and pink are passing by,
We sit in silence, no need to try,
Just you and me, as the night draws nigh.

[Chorus]
Sunset vibes, feel the glow,
The world is slowing down, taking it slow,
With the evening breeze, we let it go,
Sunset vibes, this is all we know.

[Verse 2]
The waves are whispering, the stars appear,
No rush, just moments to hold dear,
Everything is perfect, no need for fear,
In this golden hour, we’re crystal clear.

[Chorus]
Sunset vibes, feel the glow,
The world is slowing down, taking it slow,
With the evening breeze, we let it go,
Sunset vibes, this is all we know.

[Bridge]
As the sky turns dark, we stay here,
The world fades away, but you’re near,
This moment is perfect, crystal clear,
Sunset vibes, there's nothing to fear.

[Chorus]
Sunset vibes, feel the glow,
The world is slowing down, taking it slow,
With the evening breeze, we let it go,
Sunset vibes, this is all we know.

[Outro]
Sunset vibes, we’ll never leave,
The colors fade, but we still believe,
In this moment, there’s nothing to retrieve,
Sunset vibes, we’ll always achieve.
