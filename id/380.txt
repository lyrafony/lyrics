Title: Broken to Build

[Verse 1]
The walls I raised began to fall
The plans I made, I lost them all
What once was solid cracked and gave
And in the rubble, I was brave

[Verse 2]
I knelt among the shattered stone
And whispered, “Now I′m not alone”
The silence answered, not with sound
But with the strength beneath the ground

[Chorus]
I was broken to build, not left to fade
Torn apart so truth could invade
Each piece laid bare, each flaw revealed
Was where a deeper grace was sealed

[Verse 3]
The scaffold’s gone, the mask removed
The soul beneath no longer proved
By what I own or what I show
But by the roots I’ve come to know

[Chorus]
I was broken to build, not left to fade
Torn apart so truth could invade
Each piece laid bare, each flaw revealed
Was where a deeper grace was sealed

[Bridge]
You don’t need strength that will not bend
But hearts that break and still defend
And what I feared would end my song
Became the place where I belong

[Final Chorus]
I was broken to build, not torn to waste
This ruin holds a holy taste
The cracks now frame what can’t be killed
Because I’m not lost—I′m being built
