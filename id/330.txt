[Verse]
I feel the storm rising inside,
A tidal wave, no place to hide.
The chaos calls, I can’t resist,
The urge to break, to clench my fist.

[Chorus]
Out of control, I’m losing my grip,
The world’s slipping, I’m starting to slip.
I can’t hold back, I can’t take the strain,
I’m out of control, drowning in pain.

[Verse]
The walls are closing, the pressure’s too much,
I’m reaching the edge, I feel the touch.
Of madness, of rage, it’s all I know,
I’ll burn it all down and let it go.

[Chorus]
Out of control, I’m losing my grip,
The world’s slipping, I’m starting to slip.
I can’t hold back, I can’t take the strain,
I’m out of control, drowning in pain.

[Bridge]
The fire inside, it’s breaking through,
I’ll burn the world, make it new.
I’ll lose myself, but I won’t care,
Out of control, I’ll tear through the air.

[Chorus]
Out of control, I’m losing my grip,
The world’s slipping, I’m starting to slip.
I can’t hold back, I can’t take the strain,
I’m out of control, drowning in pain.

[Outro]
Out of control, I’ll crash and burn,
But from the ashes, I’ll return.
