[Verse 1]
Chasing the wind, I hear the call,
A warrior’s spirit, standing tall.
Through endless battles, I will fight,
Under the stars, beneath the night.

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel the fire burning deep inside,
A destiny that I can′t deny.
Rising above the clouds so high,
With every step, I reach for the sky.

[Chorus]
Shining bright like a thousand suns,
I’m born to run, I won’t be undone.
Through the storm, I’ll rise again,
A warrior’s heart will never bend.

[Verse 2]
The world may crumble, the earth may shake,
But I won’t falter, I won’t break.
In the silence, I hear my voice,
Guiding me to make the choice.

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel the fire burning deep inside,
A destiny that I can′t deny.
Rising above the clouds so high,
With every step, I reach for the sky.

[Chorus]
Shining bright like a thousand suns,
I’m born to run, I won’t be undone.
Through the storm, I’ll rise again,
A warrior’s heart will never bend.

[Bridge]
In the darkest hour, I’ll stand strong,
With every breath, I’ll carry on.
Through the trials, I’ll find my way,
I’ll fight until the break of day.

[Chorus]
Shining bright like a thousand suns,
I’m born to run, I won’t be undone.
Through the storm, I’ll rise again,
A warrior’s heart will never bend.
