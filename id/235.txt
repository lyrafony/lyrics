[Verse]
I’m standing on the edge tonight,
Where shadows blend with burning light.
The rhythm calls, it pulls me in,
A journey where the dark begins.

[Chorus]
Dive into the depths below,
Where secrets bloom and spirits grow.
Through every pulse, through every sound,
We’ll find ourselves when we’re unbound.

[Verse]
The air is thick, the night is raw,
A heartbeat synced to something more.
No turning back, no fear to stay,
This is where the wild ones play.

[Bridge]
Ohhh… ohhh…
Falling deeper into the haze…
Ohhh… ohhh…
Lost within the neon blaze…

[Outro]
We run, we fight, we break the chain,
Forever chasing through the pain.
In every beat, a spark ignites,
Forever dancing through the nights.
