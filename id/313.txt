[Verse 1]
Raindrops fall and call my name,
Whisper soft, no need for blame.
In every drop, a story told,
Of silent tears and hearts grown cold.

[Verse 2]
The sky weeps what I can′t say,
Washing all my fears away.
In the storm, I find my place,
In rain’s embrace, a gentle grace.

[Chorus]
Rain knows my name, it calls me home,
Through winds that shake and skies that roam.
No need to hide, no need to fight,
The rain’s my friend in darkest night.

[Bridge]
Every drop a memory,
Falling soft so tenderly.
In rain’s song, I’m not alone,
A heart of stone, now gently grown.

[Outro]
Raindrops fall and call my name,
Whisper soft — I’m not the same.
