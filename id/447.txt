Title: The Door I Didn’t Open

[Verse 1]
I stood outside with shaking hands
A silent room I didn’t understand
The key was there, but cold and still
I chose to wait against my will

[Verse 2]
Regrets like shadows on the floor
Whispers of what came before
I locked myself away from light
Afraid to face what’s wrong or right

[Chorus]
The door I didn’t open stays closed tight
But somewhere waiting just out of sight
A promise waits beyond the wall
No judgment here if I should fall
I hear a knock I never heard
Though I ignored every word
The door I didn’t open
Still waits for me to turn

[Verse 3]
I ran from calls I didn’t know
From warmth I feared to show
Yet in the silence, something stirred
A patient love without a word

[Chorus]
The door I didn’t open stays closed tight
But somewhere waiting just out of sight
A promise waits beyond the wall
No judgment here if I should fall
I hear a knock I never heard
Though I ignored every word
The door I didn’t open
Still waits for me to turn

[Bridge]
No need to beg, no need to plead
No faults counted, no debts to feed
Just open hands and open space
A welcome not erased

[Final Chorus]
The door I didn’t open stays closed tight
But the waiting love won’t say goodnight
And when I’m ready, when I yearn
The door I didn’t open
Will finally turn
