Verse 1
You call me up, you cry all night,
But when I need you, you’re out of sight.
I’m not your shrink, I’m not your mom,
Find someone else to sing your sad songs.

Pre-Chorus
I’ve heard enough of your endless pain,
While you ignore the love I gave.
I’m done being strong for the both of us,
This one-sided game is making me bust.

Chorus
I’m not your therapist, I’m not your muse,
I won’t sit around while you abuse.
My time is mine, my heart’s not free,
So take your baggage somewhere else to see.
I’m not your therapist, I’m not your cure,
I’m more than just a shoulder to endure.
Find someone new to hear your cries,
I’m done playing the role of your prize.

Verse 2
You talk and talk, but it’s all about you,
Never once asking how I’m doing too.
I gave my all, but it wasn’t enough,
Now I’m walking away—it’s getting rough.

Pre-Chorus
I’m not a sponge for your heavy load,
I’ve got my own path, my own road.
If you can’t see me as your equal,
Then this relationship’s not official.

Chorus
I’m not your therapist, I’m not your muse,
I won’t sit around while you abuse.
My time is mine, my heart’s not free,
So take your baggage somewhere else to see.
I’m not your therapist, I’m not your cure,
I’m more than just a shoulder to endure.
Find someone new to hear your cries,
I’m done playing the role of your prize.

Bridge
Maybe one day you’ll understand,
Love’s not a one-sided demand.
I’ve got dreams, I’ve got goals,
I won’t lose myself to fill your holes.

Final Chorus (Outro)
I’m not your therapist, I’m not your muse,
I won’t sit around while you abuse.
My time is mine, my heart’s not free,
So take your baggage somewhere else to see.
I’m not your therapist, I’m not your cure,
I’m more than just a shoulder to endure.
Find someone new to hear your cries,
I’m done playing the role of your prize.

Your prize… yeah, I’m done tonight.
