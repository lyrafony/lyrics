[Intro]
Ticking clocks, a whispered crime,
Living life on borrowed time.

[Verse 1]
The hours slip through open hands,
Like falling grains of heavy sand.
Promises we meant to keep,
Buried in the dust of sleep.

[Pre-Chorus]
Every second, a stolen light,
Every heartbeat, a fading fight.

[Chorus]
Borrowed time, burning fast,
Holding moments that can′t last.
Breath by breath, we chase the line,
Living dreams on borrowed time.

[Verse 2]
Empty streets and neon skies,
Trading truth for sweeter lies.
Ashes fall on broken days,
Still we dance, still we stay.

[Pre-Chorus]
Every second, a stolen light,
Every heartbeat, a fading fight.

[Chorus]
Borrowed time, burning fast,
Holding moments that can′t last.
Breath by breath, we chase the line,
Living dreams on borrowed time.

[Bridge]
No rewinds, no second chance,
Just the fire of this dance.
Tonight we blaze, tomorrow′s blind,
We are ghosts on borrowed time.

[Outro]
Borrowed time, fading slow,
Borrowed time, all we know.
