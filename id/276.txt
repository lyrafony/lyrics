[Verse 1]
In the quiet, we confess,
Secrets bloom like midnight dress.
Every word ignites a spark,
Lighting fires in the dark.

[Pre-Chorus]
No one hears, no one sees,
Hidden truths beneath the trees.
Your voice hums soft, a melody,
A symphony of you and me.

[Chorus]
Secret whispers in the night,
Weaving shadows into light.
In the silence, we collide,
Forbidden dreams we can’t hide.

[Verse 2]
Breathless moments steal the air,
Fingers trace what we won’t dare.
Every glance, a silent plea,
Bound by secrets, just you and me.

[Pre-Chorus]
No one hears, no one sees,
Hidden truths beneath the trees.
Your voice hums soft, a melody,
A symphony of you and me.

[Chorus]
Secret whispers in the night,
Weaving shadows into light.
In the silence, we collide,
Forbidden dreams we can’t hide.

[Bridge]
If the world should ever know,
Would they let us let go?
But for now, we’ll stay concealed,
Our love a secret, forever sealed.

[Chorus]
Secret whispers in the night,
Weaving shadows into light.
In the silence, we collide,
Forbidden dreams we can’t hide.

[Outro]
Secret whispers fade to gray,
Yet they linger every day.
In the stillness, I hear your name,
A whispered echo, a burning flame.
