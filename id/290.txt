[Verse 1]
I rise from the ashes, reborn anew,
With the fire inside, I break through.
The sky opens wide, as I take flight,
A warrior’s soul, burning bright.

[Pre-Chorus]
Through the flames, I feel no fear,
The winds are strong, but I draw near.
With every beat, my heart takes wing,
I rise again, and feel the sting.

[Chorus]
Wings of the Phoenix, take me high,
Through the fire, I’ll touch the sky.
Born from the flames, I’ll never fall,
A warrior’s spirit, standing tall.

[Verse 2]
The ashes of the past fade away,
In the light of a brand-new day.
The struggle is fierce, but I won’t break,
I’ll keep soaring, for my own sake.

[Pre-Chorus]
Through the flames, I feel no fear,
The winds are strong, but I draw near.
With every beat, my heart takes wing,
I rise again, and feel the sting.

[Chorus]
Wings of the Phoenix, take me high,
Through the fire, I’ll touch the sky.
Born from the flames, I’ll never fall,
A warrior’s spirit, standing tall.

[Bridge]
I’ll burn through the night, leave nothing behind,
Rising from the ashes, with a heart that’s blind.
The Phoenix will fly, unstoppable, free,
A symbol of strength for all to see.

[Chorus]
Wings of the Phoenix, take me high,
Through the fire, I’ll touch the sky.
Born from the flames, I’ll never fall,
A warrior’s spirit, standing tall.
