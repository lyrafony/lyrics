[Verse 1]
The days move slowly, the nights are long,
But your memory lingers, it’s where I belong.
Though you’re not here, I feel you near,
Your love’s a shadow, always clear.

[Pre-Chorus]
Every step I take, every turn I find,
Your voice is with me, always on my mind.

[Chorus]
Always on my mind, no matter where I go,
Your love’s a flame that keeps on glowing slow.
In every dream, in every tear I cry,
You’re the reason why my heart won’t say goodbye.
Always on my mind, through space and time,
I’ll carry you forever, you’re mine.

[Verse 2]
The world keeps spinning, but I stand still,
Caught in the moments of your will.
Your laughter echoes, your touch remains,
A love so strong, it eases all my pains.

[Pre-Chorus]
No distance breaks what we once had,
Even in silence, it makes me glad.

[Chorus]
Always on my mind, no matter where I go,
Your love’s a flame that keeps on glowing slow.
In every dream, in every tear I cry,
You’re the reason why my heart won’t say goodbye.
Always on my mind, through space and time,
I’ll carry you forever, you’re mine.

[Bridge]
Oh, the years may pass, the seasons fade,
But your love’s a song that never sways.
Every moment shared, every word unsaid,
Lives in my soul, where love is fed.

[Final Chorus]
Always on my mind, no matter where I go,
Your love’s a flame that keeps on glowing slow.
In every dream, in every tear I cry,
You’re the reason why my heart won’t say goodbye.
Always on my mind, through space and time,
I’ll carry you forever, you’re mine.

[Outro]
Always on my mind…
Forever yours, forever mine…
