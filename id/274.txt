[Verse 1]
The echoes scream, but they won’t define,
A fractured mirror of a world confined.
I’ll break the glass, I’ll claim the fight,
No chains remain beneath this light.

[Pre-Chorus]
The past is gone, the future’s mine,
I’ll leave the echoes far behind.

[Chorus]
Shatter the echoes, let them fall,
No chains to bind me, no walls at all.
I’ll rise above, I’ll carve my name,
Through fire and shadow—I stake my claim.

[Verse 2]
Your whispers fade, your grip won’t hold,
I’m made of fire, not of gold.
Every scar becomes my guide,
Through endless storms, I’ll never hide.

[Pre-Chorus]
The past is gone, the future’s mine,
I’ll leave the echoes far behind.

[Chorus]
Shatter the echoes, let them fall,
No chains to bind me, no walls at all.
I’ll rise above, I’ll carve my name,
Through fire and shadow—I stake my claim.

[Bridge]
Let the silence crush their lies,
Let the truth ignite the skies.
Every echo fades to dust,
From the ruins rises what we trust.

[Final Chorus]
Shatter the echoes, hear them break,
No more shadows left to take.
I’ll burn the night, I’ll face the sun,
This war is over—it’s already won.
