[Intro]
A flicker in the sky, then it′s gone,
A moment’s light that never belonged.

[Verse 1]
I watch the stars fall one by one,
The night swallowed by the rising sun.
A spark of light, a fleeting grace,
Now lost in time, erased from space.

[Pre-Chorus]
They were there, shining bright,
Now fading fast into the night.
So many dreams, so many fears,
Like stars that disappear through the years.

[Chorus]
Fading stars, fading fast,
Just like memories from the past.
A blink of light, then it’s gone,
We chase the moments, we move on.

[Verse 2]
The darkness comes, and the sky turns cold,
We hold on to dreams that can′t be sold.
But stars will burn, then fall away,
Just like the nights, just like the days.

[Pre-Chorus]
They were there, shining bright,
Now fading fast into the night.
So many dreams, so many fears,
Like stars that disappear through the years.

[Chorus]
Fading stars, fading fast,
Just like memories from the past.
A blink of light, then it’s gone,
We chase the moments, we move on.

[Bridge]
And as they fade, I close my eyes,
The sky no longer holds its prize.
But in the dark, I still can see,
The light that once belonged to me.

[Outro]
Fading stars, fading fast,
But in the silence, we still last.
