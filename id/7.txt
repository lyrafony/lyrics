[Verse 1]
Under the stars, we walk hand in hand,
The night is quiet, but we understand,
No words are needed, just the moon’s command,
In this starlit night, we’re on our own land.

[Chorus]
Starlit nights, the sky so wide,
Under the moon, with you by my side,
We don’t need to run, no need to hide,
Starlit nights, with you, we glide.

[Verse 2]
The air is cool, the world fades away,
Just you and me, we’re here to stay,
No time to waste, no need to pray,
In the starlit night, we find our way.

[Chorus]
Starlit nights, the sky so wide,
Under the moon, with you by my side,
We don’t need to run, no need to hide,
Starlit nights, with you, we glide.

[Bridge]
The stars are our guide, we’re moving slow,
With every step, we begin to glow,
In this stillness, we’re all aglow,
Starlit nights, where the cool winds blow.

[Chorus]
Starlit nights, the sky so wide,
Under the moon, with you by my side,
We don’t need to run, no need to hide,
Starlit nights, with you, we glide.

[Outro]
Starlit nights, we won’t forget,
The stars above, our hearts are set,
Together we shine, without regret,
Starlit nights, our souls are met.
