[Verse]
I’m torn apart, I’m shattered, broken,
Pieces scattered, all the words unspoken.
You tried to destroy me, tried to tear me down,
But I’ll rise from the wreckage, no longer bound.

[Chorus]
Shattered pieces, but I’ll rebuild,
Through the chaos, I’ll be fulfilled.
I’ll pick up every broken part,
And make a whole from a shattered heart.

[Verse]
The past is a memory, the future unknown,
But from the ruins, I’ve grown.
You thought I’d fall, you thought I’d fade,
But from the shattered, strength is made.

[Chorus]
Shattered pieces, but I’ll rebuild,
Through the chaos, I’ll be fulfilled.
I’ll pick up every broken part,
And make a whole from a shattered heart.

[Bridge]
Every crack, every scar,
Is a story that’ll take me far.
I’ll glue the pieces, I’ll make it right,
From the darkness, I’ll find the light.

[Chorus]
Shattered pieces, but I’ll rebuild,
Through the chaos, I’ll be fulfilled.
I’ll pick up every broken part,
And make a whole from a shattered heart.

[Outro]
The shattered pieces make me whole,
I’ve found my strength, I’ve found my soul.
