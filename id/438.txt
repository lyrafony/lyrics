[Verse 1]
I’ve heard the call behind me cry
Old voices whisper, asking why
But what I seek won’t live back there
The road is narrow, raw, and bare

[Verse 2]
Temptation waits with open arms
Paints former chains with fading charms
But I’ve unlearned the weight of lies
And set my gaze where freedom lies

[Chorus]
Eyes fixed ahead, I won’t turn back
No comfort worth what I now lack
The past can plead, the noise can swell
But forward is where mercy dwells

[Verse 3]
The steps are slow, the path is thin
But light breaks softly from within
And every mile that strips my pride
Reveals the fire I hold inside

[Chorus]
Eyes fixed ahead, I won’t turn back
No comfort worth what I now lack
The past can plead, the noise can swell
But forward is where mercy dwells

[Bridge]
Let shadows chase, let silence speak
Let every strong become the weak
I’ll walk the road I cannot see
With eyes fixed where I’m meant to be

[Final Chorus]
Eyes fixed ahead, I won’t turn back
No crown behind, no safer track
I press through doubt, through joy, through dread
My soul alive, my eyes ahead
