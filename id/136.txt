[Intro]
The beat drops low, can you hear it?
Let the rhythm guide you… feel it.

[Verse 1]
I see you moving, caught in the flow
Your energy’s magnetic, I already know
No words are needed, the vibe speaks loud
This moment’s electric, we’re lost in the crowd

The night is alive, it’s calling our name
Every step we take sets the world aflame
We’re chasing the rhythm, no need to slow
This fire between us keeps growing, I know

[Pre-Chorus]
Step by step, we’re falling deeper
The music pulls us, it’s getting sweeter
No turning back, let it take control
Baby, this is how we roll

[Chorus]
Feel the pull, it’s taking over
Our hearts are beating, they’re in sync together
No rules tonight, just you and me
Let the rhythm set us free
Feel the pull, it’s undeniable
This connection’s strong, it’s unbreakable
Together we rise, feel the spark ignite
Baby, this is our night

[Verse 2]
The bassline hums, it’s pulling me near
Your energy’s electric, I feel you clear
We’re dancing in the dark, no fear in sight
This moment’s eternal, burning so bright

Every touch, every move feels so right
The stars above guide us through the night
No limits here, just pure emotion
This beat’s the key to our devotion

[Pre-Chorus]
Step by step, we’re falling deeper
The music pulls us, it’s getting sweeter
No turning back, let it take control
Baby, this is how we roll

[Chorus]
Feel the pull, it’s taking over
Our hearts are beating, they’re in sync together
No rules tonight, just you and me
Let the rhythm set us free
Feel the pull, it’s undeniable
This connection’s strong, it’s unbreakable
Together we rise, feel the spark ignite
Baby, this is our night

[Bridge]
Ooooh…
Feel the energy rise, it’s electric
We’re floating higher, no limits
The night is endless, no end in sight
With wild hearts, we’ll own the night

[Final Chorus]
Feel the pull, it’s taking over
Our hearts are beating, they’re in sync together
No rules tonight, just you and me
Let the rhythm set us free
Feel the pull, it’s undeniable
This connection’s strong, it’s unbreakable
Together we rise, feel the spark ignite
Baby, this is our night

[Outro]
The rhythm fades, but the pull remains…
