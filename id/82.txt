[Verse 1]
The sky has fallen, its pieces torn,
scattered remnants of dreams forlorn.
But in the rubble, I see a spark,
a chance to light up the endless dark.

[Pre-Chorus]
Every shard holds a story untold,
every crack lets the new unfold.

[Chorus]
I’m rebuilding the sky with fragments of gold,
from ashes and dust, a new world unfolds.
Though storms may rage and winds may cry,
I’ll piece together a brighter sky.

[Verse 2]
The ground beneath feels fragile, unsure,
but every step makes the path endure.
With hands worn raw and a heart that’s free,
I’ll craft a horizon where I can breathe.

[Bridge]
The past is broken, but not erased,
its lessons etched in time and space.
From chaos rises a steady flame,
turning endings into a brand-new name.

[Final Section]
I’m rebuilding the sky with fragments of gold,
from ashes and dust, a new world unfolds.
Though storms may rage and winds may cry,
I’ll piece together a brighter sky.
