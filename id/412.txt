[Verse 1]
Behind the veil, a hidden light
Shining through the depths of night
A glow that softens every fear
A truth revealed, forever near

[Verse 2]
Unseen hands that gently part
The curtains drawn around the heart
A radiant veil, pure and bright
Illuminates the darkest night

[Chorus]
Radiant veil, a sacred gleam
Unfolding like a tender dream
Beneath its light, the spirit soars
Unlocking long-forgotten doors

[Verse 3]
In silent awe, the soul perceives
The mystery that light conceives
A gentle fire that never fails
The grace bestowed by radiant veils

[Chorus]
Radiant veil, a sacred gleam
Unfolding like a tender dream
Beneath its light, the spirit soars
Unlocking long-forgotten doors

[Bridge]
Though shadows try to veil the way
The radiant veil will never sway
A beacon shining pure and clear
Guiding hearts forever near

[Final Chorus]
Radiant veil, a sacred gleam
Unfolding like a tender dream
Beneath its light, the spirit soars
Unlocking long-forgotten doors
