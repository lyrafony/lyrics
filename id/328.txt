[Verse]
The silence is deafening, it tears me apart,
A storm raging inside, a broken heart.
No one hears the screams, no one sees the fight,
But the rage builds up in the dead of night.

[Chorus]
Crushing silence, can’t break free,
I’m screaming inside, but it’s not for them to see.
In the stillness, I’ll lose control,
A crushing silence, taking its toll.

[Verse]
The words are choking, they won’t come out,
Drowning in silence, filled with doubt.
Every moment’s a battle, every breath a war,
I’ll fight this silence forever more.

[Chorus]
Crushing silence, can’t break free,
I’m screaming inside, but it’s not for them to see.
In the stillness, I’ll lose control,
A crushing silence, taking its toll.

[Bridge]
This quiet rage is louder than any sound,
I’ll rise from this silence, tearing it down.
My voice will break through, I’ll make them hear,
The crushing silence will disappear.

[Chorus]
Crushing silence, can’t break free,
I’m screaming inside, but it’s not for them to see.
In the stillness, I’ll lose control,
A crushing silence, taking its toll.

[Outro]
I’ll break the silence, I’ll make them see,
The rage inside will set me free.
