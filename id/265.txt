[Verse 1]
I feel the spark ignite in my veins,
A storm is brewing; it breaks these chains.
Every wound I’ve carried starts to burn,
From the ashes rises what I yearn.

[Pre-Chorus]
This fire’s not for vengeance, it’s for change,
A roaring flame that nothing can estrange.

[Chorus]
Fragments of fury, they cut through the haze,
Fuel for the fight in these darker days.
I’ll wield the shards of all I’ve lost,
Turn this rage into gold at any cost.

[Verse 2]
They tried to bury me beneath their weight,
But every scar became a trait of fate.
Now I rise with thunder in my stride,
The fragments sharpened—my sword and guide.

[Pre-Chorus]
This fire’s not for vengeance, it’s for truth,
A blaze unyielding from my youth.

[Chorus]
Fragments of fury, they cut through the haze,
Fuel for the fight in these darker days.
I’ll wield the shards of all I’ve lost,
Turn this rage into gold at any cost.

[Bridge]
Let the embers fall where shadows crawl,
I’ll build my empire from the gall.
Each fragment whispers, ″You’re not alone,″
Together they scream—we’ll overthrow the throne.

[Final Chorus]
Fragments of fury, they light up the skies,
No fear remains when the spirit flies.
I’ll forge ahead, no chains can hold,
From fragments of fury, my story unfolds.

[Outro]
So let them tremble, let them see,
What happens when you set the beast in me.
Fragments of fury—they’ll never fade,
For every wound made me unafraid.
