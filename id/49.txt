Verse 1
You said we’re through, so I walked away,
But your mom still texts me every day.
She sends me memes, she sends me pie,
Says you’re a mess since we said goodbye.

Pre-Chorus
I didn’t plan it, but it’s kinda sweet,
She calls me “honey” when we meet.
Guess I’m the daughter she never had,
And now you’re mad—that’s kinda bad.

Chorus
Your mom likes me better, it’s true,
She says you’re lazy, and she’s over you.
She texts me late, she checks on my life,
Sorry, dude, but she’s Team Ex-Wife.
Your mom likes me better, no doubt,
She even said I’m what you’re about.
Too bad for you, this bond is tight,
I’ve got your mom on my side tonight.

Verse 2
She tells me secrets, she spills the tea,
About how you never visit or call her, see?
I laugh it off, but deep inside,
It feels so good to have her on my side.

Pre-Chorus
You burned the bridge, but I stayed near,
Now your mom’s my biggest cheer.
Karma’s sweet when it comes around,
And this time, it’s wearing your mom’s crown.

Chorus
Your mom likes me better, it’s true,
She says you’re lazy, and she’s over you.
She texts me late, she checks on my life,
Sorry, dude, but she’s Team Ex-Wife.
Your mom likes me better, no doubt,
She even said I’m what you’re about.
Too bad for you, this bond is tight,
I’ve got your mom on my side tonight.

Bridge
Maybe next time you’ll treat her right,
Instead of acting like she’s out of sight.
But until then, I’ll take the win,
Your mom and me—we’re thick as skin.

Final Chorus (Outro)
Your mom likes me better, it’s true,
She says you’re lazy, and she’s over you.
She texts me late, she checks on my life,
Sorry, dude, but she’s Team Ex-Wife.
Your mom likes me better, no doubt,
She even said I’m what you’re about.
Too bad for you, this bond is tight,
I’ve got your mom on my side tonight.

On my side tonight… yeah, she’s mine.
