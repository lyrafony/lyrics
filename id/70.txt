[Verse 1]
I cried for the nights that never came back,
For promises broken and love turned black.
Every drop I gave was a piece of my soul,
But you threw them away like they didn’t matter at all.

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I see the truth in the blur of my pain,
Those tears were wasted on someone so vain.
But I won’t let regret take the reins anymore,
I’ll rise from the ashes and even the score.

[Chorus]
Wasted tears, they fell like rain,
Watering a garden that wouldn’t grow again.
But I’m done with the sorrow, I’m done with the lies,
These wasted tears are where my strength now lies.

[Verse 2]
The echoes of heartbreak still linger tonight,
But I’m done chasing shadows; I’ve found my light.
Every tear I shed was a lesson in disguise,
Now I wear the wisdom behind these tired eyes.

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I see the truth in the blur of my pain,
Those tears were wasted on someone so vain.
But I won’t let regret take the reins anymore,
I’ll rise from the ashes and even the score.

[Chorus]
Wasted tears, they fell like rain,
Watering a garden that wouldn’t grow again.
But I’m done with the sorrow, I’m done with the lies,
These wasted tears are where my strength now lies.

[Bridge]
Oh, I poured my heart into a bottomless sea,
But now I’m reclaiming all the pieces of me.
The past can’t hurt me; it’s lost its sting,
From wasted tears, I’ve built everything.

[Final Section]
Wasted tears, they’re not in vain,
They taught me to fight through the heaviest rain.
Now I stand tall, with nothing to fear,
My wasted tears made me crystal clear.
