[Verse 1]
Eyes unseen, they scan the crowd
Voices lost, yet speaking loud
Strings pulled tight behind the scene
Masters hidden, rarely seen

[Verse 2]
Whispers spread on guarded lips
Plans unfold in shadowed scripts
The watchers wait with cold command
Shaping fate with unseen hand

[Chorus]
Silent watchers, eyes that gleam
Turning wheels behind the scheme
Though we move unaware, confined
Truth awaits the patient mind

[Verse 3]
The veil is thick, the masks endure
But hearts resist, their faith is sure
In quiet strength, the spirit wakes
And breaks the chains that power makes

[Chorus]
Silent watchers, eyes that gleam
Turning wheels behind the scheme
Though we move unaware, confined
Truth awaits the patient mind

[Bridge]
Though silence reigns and shadows creep
The dawn will break, the walls will seep
And in that light, the blind will see
The truth that sets the captives free

[Final Chorus]
Silent watchers, eyes that gleam
Turning wheels behind the scheme
Though we move unaware, confined
Truth awaits the patient mind
