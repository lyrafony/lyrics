[Verse 1]
I run through streets of broken dreams,
Chasing ghosts in electric streams.
Your shadow haunts my every move,
A phantom love I can’t remove.

[Pre-Chorus]
Every corner whispers your name,
Yet you’re never the same.
The city hums with memories,
But you’re lost in the breeze.

[Chorus]
Chasing ghosts, I’m losing ground,
In the silence, no sound.
Every step feels like a lie,
You’re a shadow in the sky.

[Verse 2]
Neon lights blur the lines of truth,
Searching for the ghost of youth.
I reach for echoes in the air,
But nothing’s there, no one to care.

[Pre-Chorus]
Every corner whispers your name,
Yet you’re never the same.
The city hums with memories,
But you’re lost in the breeze.

[Chorus]
Chasing ghosts, I’m losing ground,
In the silence, no sound.
Every step feels like a lie,
You’re a shadow in the sky.

[Bridge]
Maybe you were never real,
Just a wound I can’t heal.
The harder I try to hold on tight,
The further you drift from sight.

[Chorus]
Chasing ghosts, I’m losing ground,
In the silence, no sound.
Every step feels like a lie,
You’re a shadow in the sky.

[Outro]
Chasing ghosts, I fade away,
Lost in shadows, night and day.
The city swallows all my cries,
A phantom love that never dies.
