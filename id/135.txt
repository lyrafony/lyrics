[Intro]
Let’s go…

[Verse 1]
I saw you standing there, lost in the sound
Your body moving like it owns the ground
No words were spoken, but I felt your call
I crossed the floor, ready to fall

The music’s loud, but your vibe is louder
Every step you take pulls me closer
This isn’t just a dance, it’s something more
A spark ignites as we explore

[Pre-Chorus]
Step by step, we’re losing control
The rhythm’s guiding us, taking its toll
No need to rush, let it take its time
Baby, this moment’s ours to define

[Chorus]
Baila conmigo, feel the heat rise
Move your body, let the night surprise
We’re alive, we’re electric
This connection’s magnetic
Baila conmigo, let’s make it last
Turn the music up, forget the past
Together we shine, brighter than gold
Baby, this story’s yet untold

[Verse 2]
The bass is pounding, matching our hearts
Every move we make feels like art
Your hands on mine, they tell a tale
Of passion and fire, nothing can fail

The world fades out, it’s just you and me
No rules tonight, just pure energy
This dance is endless, no end in sight
We’ll keep it burning till morning light

[Pre-Chorus]
Step by step, we’re losing control
The rhythm’s guiding us, taking its toll
No need to rush, let it take its time
Baby, this moment’s ours to define

[Chorus]
Baila conmigo, feel the heat rise
Move your body, let the night surprise
We’re alive, we’re electric
This connection’s magnetic
Baila conmigo, let’s make it last
Turn the music up, forget the past
Together we shine, brighter than gold
Baby, this story’s yet untold

[Bridge]
Ooooh…
Feel the rhythm guide us, deeper than before
Our bodies speaking louder than words
No boundaries now, just you and me
This is our symphony

[Final Chorus]
Baila conmigo, feel the heat rise
Move your body, let the night surprise
We’re alive, we’re electric
This connection’s magnetic
Baila conmigo, let’s make it last
Turn the music up, forget the past
Together we shine, brighter than gold
Baby, this story’s yet untold

[Outro]
Baila conmigo…
