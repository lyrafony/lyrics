[Verse 1]
The weight we carry bends our spine,
a quiet burden, a fragile sign.
Of battles fought and words unsaid,
of dreams that linger in the dead.

[Pre-Chorus]
It presses heavy, but makes us strong,
a silent rhythm, a lifelong song.

[Chorus]
The weight we carry shapes our soul,
it breaks us open, makes us whole.
Though it drags us through the night,
it’s the fire that fuels our light.

[Verse 2]
We share the load, though none can see,
the cracks that form from simply being.
But in the touch of another hand,
we find relief where none was planned.

[Bridge]
No one walks alone through this storm,
though each heart bears its private torn.
Together we rise, together we mend,
the weight becomes a shared ascent.

[Final Section]
The weight we carry shapes our soul,
it breaks us open, makes us whole.
Though it drags us through the night,
it’s the fire that fuels our light.
