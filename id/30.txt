(Verse 1)
I’ve been down, but I’m standing tall
We made mistakes, but it’s not the end at all
The past is gone, but we’re still here
Let’s find our way, no more fear

(Pre-Chorus)
I know we hurt, I know we cried
But love’s worth the fight, we can’t deny
It’s time to heal, time to forgive
Let’s make it right, let’s learn to live

(Chorus)
Back to us, let’s start again
A second chance, we won’t let this end
Back to us, we’ll find our way
Together stronger, we’ll be okay
Back to us, we’re starting new
A second chance, it’s me and you
Back to us, let’s make it right
We’ve got a future, we’ll be alright

(Verse 2)
We’ve been broken, but we’re not done
We’ll take it slow, we’ve just begun
We’ve learned the lessons, now we see
What love can be, what we can be

(Pre-Chorus)
I know we hurt, I know we cried
But love’s worth the fight, we can’t deny
It’s time to heal, time to forgive
Let’s make it right, let’s learn to live

(Chorus)
Back to us, let’s start again
A second chance, we won’t let this end
Back to us, we’ll find our way
Together stronger, we’ll be okay
Back to us, we’re starting new
A second chance, it’s me and you
Back to us, let’s make it right
We’ve got a future, we’ll be alright

(Bridge)
We’ve been through the fire, but we’re not burned
Every scar’s a lesson we’ve learned
We’ll build this love, brick by brick
With every step, we’ll make it stick

(Chorus - Variation)
Back to us, let’s start again
A second chance, we won’t let this end
Back to us, we’ll find our way
Together stronger, we’ll be okay
Back to us, we’re starting new
A second chance, it’s me and you
Back to us, let’s make it right
We’ve got a future, we’ll be alright

(Outro)
Back to us, back to love
We’ve found our way, sent from above
Back to us, we’re meant to be
This second chance is all we need
