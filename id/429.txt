[Verse 1]
Footsteps echo down the lane
Faces marked by silent pain
Walls that close, a tightened grip
Dreams held back on every trip

[Verse 2]
Whispers lost in crowded noise
Broken voices, stolen joys
Yet in the dark, a spark remains
A light that fights through blood and chains

[Chorus]
Shadowed streets, where hope survives
In hidden hearts, the dream revives
Though power casts a heavy hand
Faith still walks this broken land

[Verse 3]
No throne here, no gilded crown
Just souls that struggle, not bow down
The fight is real, the cost is steep
But strength is found where shadows sleep

[Chorus]
Shadowed streets, where hope survives
In hidden hearts, the dream revives
Though power casts a heavy hand
Faith still walks this broken land

[Bridge]
Through alleys dark and skies gray
The light persists, wonâ€™t fade away
And in the silence, whispers grow
Of justice coming, soft and slow

[Final Chorus]
Shadowed streets, where hope survives
In hidden hearts, the dream revives
Though power casts a heavy hand
Faith still walks this broken land
