[Intro]
Ain’t no limit to what we can do,
Keep pushin′, we gon’ make it through.

[Verse 1]
Started from the bottom, now we risin’ fast,
Kept my eyes on the prize, never lookin’ back.
They said I couldn’t do it, said I’d never last,
But now they see me winnin′, I’m built to outlast.

I’m breakin′ all the chains, tryna find my way,
They tried to hold me down, but I found a way to play.
Every step I take, I feel the weight lift,
I’m unstoppable, ain’t no limit to this gift.

[Pre-Chorus]
They can’t hold me down, no, I’m takin′ off,
Risin’ to the top, they can’t turn me off.
Every move I make, it’s all in my control,
Ain’t no limit to my heart, to my soul.

[Chorus]
Ohhh, no limit to the grind,
Pushin’ through the pain, leave it all behind.
Ohhh, we gon’ rise up, no fear,
Ain’t no limit when you’re chasin′ what’s near.

[Verse 2]
I’ve been through the fire, now I’m colder than steel,
Every battle I fought, now it’s time to heal.
They said I wasn’t ready, said I’d never shine,
Now I’m takin’ what’s mine, it’s all by design.

Life ain’t no easy road, but I’m walkin′ tall,
Can’t stop me now, watch me break down the wall.
With every step forward, the future’s lookin′ bright,
I’m the king of my destiny, I’m ready for flight.

[Pre-Chorus]
They can’t hold me down, no, I’m takin′ off,
Risin’ to the top, they can’t turn me off.
Every move I make, it’s all in my control,
Ain’t no limit to my heart, to my soul.

[Chorus]
Ohhh, no limit to the grind,
Pushin’ through the pain, leave it all behind.
Ohhh, we gon’ rise up, no fear,
Ain’t no limit when you’re chasin′ what’s near.

[Bridge]
Ain’t no holdin′ back, we’re breakin’ through,
No limit, no fear, we keep it true.

[Verse 3]
From the lows to the highs, we gon′ make it through,
Every lesson learned, it’s all part of the view.
Ain’t no limit to what we can achieve,
The world is ours, we gon′ make ‘em believe.

[Outro]
No limit… no fear…
We gon′ rise… crystal clear…
