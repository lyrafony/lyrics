(Verse 1)
I see you in my dreams, can't escape this pull
Every time I try, it only makes me want you more
You're like a drug, I can't get enough
Every second without you, feels like I'm losing touch

(Pre-Chorus)
I try to fight it, but it takes over my mind
Like a storm that I can't leave behind
I know it's dangerous, but I still want more
Baby, what’s it gonna take to settle the score?

(Chorus)
I can't let go, it’s out of my hands
I’m losing control, can't understand
You’re everywhere I go, you’re in my veins
This obsession’s driving me insane
I can't let go, I need you now
Pull me deeper, I can't back out
I’m addicted, there's no escape
I can’t let go, no, I can’t break free

(Verse 2)
Every song I hear, reminds me of you
Every place I go, it’s like you’re still in view
I tell myself, it’s time to let it go
But my heart keeps pulling me, I’m losing control

(Pre-Chorus)
I try to fight it, but it takes over my mind
Like a storm that I can't leave behind
I know it's dangerous, but I still want more
Baby, what’s it gonna take to settle the score?

(Chorus)
I can't let go, it’s out of my hands
I’m losing control, can't understand
You’re everywhere I go, you’re in my veins
This obsession’s driving me insane
I can't let go, I need you now
Pull me deeper, I can't back out
I’m addicted, there's no escape
I can’t let go, no, I can’t break free

(Bridge)
I try to breathe, but it’s hard to fight
You’ve got a hold, it feels so right
Every thought, every touch, keeps me tied
I can’t escape what’s burning inside

(Chorus - Variation)
I can't let go, it’s out of my hands
I’m losing control, can't understand
You’re everywhere I go, you’re in my veins
This obsession’s driving me insane
I can't let go, I need you now
Pull me deeper, I can't back out
I’m addicted, there's no escape
I can’t let go, no, I can’t break free

(Outro - whispered)
No, I can’t let go… I can’t break free…
I can’t let go…
