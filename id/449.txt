[Verse 1]
Lost in the haze, I can’t find my way
Whispers and shadows lead me astray
The world’s a storm I can’t outrun
No clear path under this dim sun

[Verse 2]
Voices clash like thunder and flame
Promises broken, nothing the same
But beneath the roar, so faint and low
A voice calls out I barely know

[Chorus]
The voice in the smoke, soft and clear
Cuts through the chaos, draws me near
No lightning flash, no blinding light
Just a whisper guiding me through the night

[Verse 3]
I stumble through doubts, I fight the fear
But that quiet sound feels so sincere
It doesn’t shout, it doesn’t demand
Just reaches out a gentle hand

[Chorus]
The voice in the smoke, soft and clear
Cuts through the chaos, draws me near
No lightning flash, no blinding light
Just a whisper guiding me through the night

[Bridge]
Sometimes the loudest voices lie
But truth is found where silence sighs
In that calm, I find my place
A hidden strength, a saving grace

[Final Chorus]
The voice in the smoke, soft and clear
Cuts through the chaos, draws me near
No lightning flash, no blinding light
Just a whisper guiding me through the night
