[Verse 1]
Petals on the lake,
Drifting like the love we make.
No rush, no sound,
Just the ripple all around.

[Verse 2]
You smile like the morning mist,
Soft and fading as we′re kissed.
In this quiet sacred place,
Time dissolves without a trace.

[Chorus]
I let go, you remain,
Like flowers floating after rain.
No need to ask, no need to say,
We are the wind that walks away.

[Verse 3]
Your hand, the breeze that finds my skin,
A memory that lives within.
We sit and watch the water bloom,
While sunlight warms the edge of gloom.

[Bridge]
No forever, no regret,
Only moments we won’t forget.
The lake will hold what we once were,
In every wave, a whispered stir.

[Outro]
Petals on the lake,
Drifting still, for love′s own sake.
Even when we drift apart,
You’ll remain, inside my heart.
