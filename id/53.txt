Verse 1
I played the role, I wore the mask,
Always giving, never asking back.
But now I see it’s all a game,
And I’m done playing nice—it’s not my name.

Pre-Chorus
I won’t bend, I won’t break,
I’m taking back what’s at stake.
No more apologies, no more lies,
I’m done being sweet—I’ve opened my eyes.

Chorus
No more Miss Nice Girl, I’m drawing the line,
I’m done with your games, they’re no longer mine.
I’ll speak my truth, I’ll take my stand,
This is my life—I’m in command.
No more Miss Nice Girl, I’m breaking free,
I’m done with the person you wanted me to be.
If you can’t respect me, then step aside,
I’m owning my power—I’ve got nothing to hide.

Verse 2
You took me for granted, thought I’d stay,
But I’m walking out—I’m done today.
I gave you chances, I gave you time,
But now I’m fine—yeah, I’m feeling fine.

Pre-Chorus
I’m not your doormat, I’m not your muse,
I’ve got my own rules, I’ve got my views.
You had your chance, but you blew it wide,
Now I’m stepping up—I’ve got my pride.

Chorus
No more Miss Nice Girl, I’m drawing the line,
I’m done with your games, they’re no longer mine.
I’ll speak my truth, I’ll take my stand,
This is my life—I’m in command.
No more Miss Nice Girl, I’m breaking free,
I’m done with the person you wanted me to be.
If you can’t respect me, then step aside,
I’m owning my power—I’ve got nothing to hide.
