Verse 1
You text me late, it’s always the same,
Empty words, just a pointless game.
I’ve got better things to do tonight,
Like scroll memes or watch bad TV—no fight.

Pre-Chorus
I don’t need your drama, I don’t need your lies,
I’d rather save my data and block your cries.
No signal strong enough to keep you near,
You’re not worth the Wi-Fi, it’s crystal clear.

Chorus
You’re not worth the Wi-Fi, no bytes for you,
I’ve got faster connections that feel brand new.
Save my data, save my time,
You’re not even worth a single dime.
You’re not worth the Wi-Fi, let’s be real,
I’ve got better apps and a better deal.
Swipe left on you, delete your name,
This digital love is such a shame.

Verse 2
Your voice is static, your vibe is low,
I’m out of here, I’ve got places to go.
Why waste my megabytes on your small talk?
I’ll invest in memes—they’re less of a walk.

Pre-Chorus
I don’t need your texts, I don’t need your calls,
I’ll mute your number, ignore your falls.
Life’s too short for slow replies,
And you’re buffering—just say goodbye.

Chorus
You’re not worth the Wi-Fi, no bytes for you,
I’ve got faster connections that feel brand new.
Save my data, save my time,
You’re not even worth a single dime.
You’re not worth the Wi-Fi, let’s be real,
I’ve got better apps and a better deal.
Swipe left on you, delete your name,
This digital love is such a shame.
