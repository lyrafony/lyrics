[Verse 1]
I won’t say sorry for the things I’ve done,
For walking my own path when the road felt wrong.
They can talk all they want, but I’ll never conform,
This heart beats louder than their rules and their norms.

[Pre-Chorus]
I’m done with the whispers, done with the lies,
I’ll wear my truth like warpaint, no disguise.
You can try to break me, but I’ll never fall apart,
I’m fueled by fire, I’m an unapologetic heart.

[Chorus]
I’m unapologetic, I’ll never back down,
This is my life, it’s my battleground.
I’ll scream my truth till the heavens hear,
I’m an unapologetic heart, no fear.

[Verse 2]
The mirror doesn’t lie, it shows who I am,
Bruised but unbroken, still standing my ground.
Every scar I earned is a badge of my fight,
And I’ll keep on burning through the darkest nights.

[Pre-Chorus]
I’m done with the whispers, done with the lies,
I’ll wear my truth like warpaint, no disguise.
You can try to break me, but I’ll never fall apart,
I’m fueled by fire, I’m an unapologetic heart.

[Chorus]
I’m unapologetic, I’ll never back down,
This is my life, it’s my battleground.
I’ll scream my truth till the heavens hear,
I’m an unapologetic heart, no fear.

[Bridge]
Oh, they can throw their stones, try to tear me apart,
But I’ll rise from the ashes with a fearless heart.
This is my story, these are my scars,
I’ll never apologize for who I are.

[Final Chorus]
I’m unapologetic, I’ll never back down,
This is my life, it’s my battleground.
I’ll scream my truth till the heavens hear,
I’m an unapologetic heart, no fear.

[Outro]
Unapologetic heart, I’ll never change,
I’ll burn brighter than the pain.
This is me, take it or leave,
An unapologetic heart, I breathe.
