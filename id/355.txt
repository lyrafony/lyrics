[Verse]
Beneath the steel and broken vines,
Echoes hum through crooked spines.
Dreams grow twisted in the sand,
Feeding roots of a dying land.

[Pre-Chorus]
I wander through the wilted rows,
Where rusted flowers try to grow.

[Chorus]
Rust gardens bloom inside my head,
Tangled hope and things unsaid.
Crimson leaves and iron stems,
Ghosts of life that won’t condemn.

[Verse]
Footsteps sink in ash and stone,
Carving scars through lands unknown.
Faded paths and wilted blooms,
Lost inside these iron tombs.

[Pre-Chorus]
I wander through the wilted rows,
Where rusted flowers try to grow.

[Chorus]
Rust gardens bloom inside my head,
Tangled hope and things unsaid.
Crimson leaves and iron stems,
Ghosts of life that won’t condemn.

[Bridge]
Silent petals cut the breeze,
Slicing through forgotten pleas.
Tears fall heavy in the dust,
Watering the fields of rust.

[Chorus]
Rust gardens bloom inside my head,
Tangled hope and things unsaid.
Crimson leaves and iron stems,
Ghosts of life that won’t condemn.
