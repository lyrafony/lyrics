[Verse 1]
The coffee's colder, the sky's a little grey
The sunlight doesn’t hit the same way
I walk the streets but it feels so empty
Used to feel the magic, now it’s just a memory

[Pre-Chorus]
I’m talking to myself like I’m still waiting for you
I’m reaching for the moments that we used to do
The world’s a little quieter, but the silence screams
Without you, nothing feels like it used to be

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, without you, it’s not the same
The little things we did just don’t have a name
Oh, oh, oh, I still hear your voice in the rain
But without you, baby, it’s never the same

[Verse 2]
The days move slower, the nights are so long
I’m listening to our song, but it feels all wrong
Every little smile we shared, gone with the breeze
Now I’m chasing echoes, trying to find peace

[Pre-Chorus]
I’m talking to myself like I’m still waiting for you
I’m reaching for the moments that we used to do
The world’s a little quieter, but the silence screams
Without you, nothing feels like it used to be

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, without you, it’s not the same
The little things we did just don’t have a name
Oh, oh, oh, I still hear your voice in the rain
But without you, baby, it’s never the same

[Bridge]
The stars don’t shine as bright, oh-oh
I keep thinking you’ll come back, but no, no
It’s just a memory, fading slow
And now I know, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, without you, it’s not the same
The little things we did just don’t have a name
Oh, oh, oh, I still hear your voice in the rain
But without you, baby, it’s never the same

[Outro]
Oh-oh-oh, it’s not the same, no
Without you, oh, oh-oh, it’s never the same
