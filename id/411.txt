[Verse 1]
In quiet bays where waters rest
The weary find their place of rest
Sheltered harbors, calm and deep
Where souls may dream and softly keep

[Verse 2]
Beneath the stars, a gentle tide
Carries hope that wonâ€™t subside
A refuge safe from storm and strife
A sanctuary of new life

[Chorus]
Harbors of the heart, serene and wide
Where peace and grace forever hide
Through waves that crash and winds that part
The soul finds calm in harbors of the heart

[Verse 3]
Though storms may rage and nights may fall
Within these shores, the soul stands tall
Anchored strong through every wave
In sacred rest, the heart will save

[Chorus]
Harbors of the heart, serene and wide
Where peace and grace forever hide
Through waves that crash and winds that part
The soul finds calm in harbors of the heart

[Bridge]
A quiet voice, a whispered prayer
A gentle hand that lingers there
In these harbors, safe and true
The spirit finds its strength anew

[Final Chorus]
Harbors of the heart, serene and wide
Where peace and grace forever hide
Through waves that crash and winds that part
The soul finds calm in harbors of the heart
