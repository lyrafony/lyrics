[Verse 1]
From the ashes, I will rise,
With fire burning in my eyes.
Through the darkness, I have fought,
Now I’m stronger than I thought.

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel the flames, they light my soul,
A rebirth, I’m becoming whole.
From the ground, I will ascend,
A phoenix rising in the end.

[Chorus]
Rise, rise like the burning flame,
From the ashes, I’ll reclaim my name.
No more fear, no more pain,
I’ll rise, I’ll rise again.

[Verse 2]
Through the storm, through the rain,
I’ve weathered all, I’ve felt the strain.
But now the sky is clear and bright,
And I am ready for the fight.

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel the flames, they light my soul,
A rebirth, I’m becoming whole.
From the ground, I will ascend,
A phoenix rising in the end.

[Chorus]
Rise, rise like the burning flame,
From the ashes, I’ll reclaim my name.
No more fear, no more pain,
I’ll rise, I’ll rise again.

[Bridge]
In the flames, I’ve found my strength,
I’ll burn again, I’ll go to great lengths.
The world may crumble, the skies may fall,
But I will rise above it all.

[Chorus]
Rise, rise like the burning flame,
From the ashes, I’ll reclaim my name.
No more fear, no more pain,
I’ll rise, I’ll rise again.
