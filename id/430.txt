--

[Verse 1]
Not in thrones or halls of gold
A quiet power, calm and bold
Unseen hand that guides the way
Through darkest night and brightest day

[Verse 2]
No banners fly, no trumpets sound
Yet in this silence, strength is found
A sovereign reign beyond all sight
A hidden truth that brings the light

[Chorus]
Unseen King, You hold the reigns
Beyond the noise, beyond the chains
Though shadows rise and empires fall
Your justice stands, the hope of all

[Verse 3]
When rulers falter, kingdoms fade
Your steady hand will not be swayed
In quiet grace, Your voice is heard
The promise held in every word

[Chorus]
Unseen King, You hold the reigns
Beyond the noise, beyond the chains
Though shadows rise and empires fall
Your justice stands, the hope of all

[Bridge]
No earthly crown can match Your power
Your kingdom comes in darkest hour
And in Your light, we find our way
The dawn of hope, the endless day

[Final Chorus]
Unseen King, You hold the reigns
Beyond the noise, beyond the chains
Though shadows rise and empires fall
Your justice stands, the hope of all
