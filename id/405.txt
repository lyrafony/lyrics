[Verse 1]
Through silent depths, the rivers flow
Veins of light where secrets grow
A sacred pulse beneath the skin
The breath of grace that dwells within

[Verse 2]
Unseen currents weave and bind
Threads of power, pure and kind
With holy fire, the spirit gleams
Awakening eternal dreams

[Chorus]
Veins of light, eternal streams
Flowing deep through mortal dreams
In sacred halls where silence sings
The soul receives what heaven brings

[Verse 3]
In whispered winds, the power breathes
Unfurling wings beneath the leaves
A holy flame, a boundless sea
That shapes the path to what shall be

[Chorus]
Veins of light, eternal streams
Flowing deep through mortal dreams
In sacred halls where silence sings
The soul receives what heaven brings

[Bridge]
With sacred might and endless grace
The spirit moves through time and space
A covenant no eye has seen
The truth that dwells in all between

[Final Chorus]
Veins of light, eternal streams
Flowing deep through mortal dreams
In sacred halls where silence sings
The soul receives what heaven brings
