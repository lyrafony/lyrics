[Verse]
I hear the echoes calling me,
A voice that lives in mystery.
The night unfolds its secrets deep,
Where shadows wake and dreams don’t sleep.

[Chorus]
In the dark, I find my light,
Guided by the stars at night.
Every step, a fleeting trace,
Through the void, I find my place.

[Verse]
Cold winds whisper through the air,
A fragile hope beyond repair.
But in the silence, I can feel,
The pulse of life, so raw, so real.

[Bridge]
Ohhh… ohhh…
Breaking free from chains unseen…
Ohhh… ohhh…
Dancing with the ghosts between…

[Outro]
We’re lost, we’re found, we’re torn apart,
Searching for the missing heart.
In the echoes, we collide,
Forever chasing the other side.
