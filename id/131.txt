[Intro]
Feel the pulse of the city…
Let’s go…

[Verse 1]
The skyline’s glowing, we’re chasing the vibe
Neon reflections dance in your eyes
Every corner whispers secrets untold
Tonight, the city’s ours to explore and unfold

We’re walking these streets like it’s our domain
The moonlight guides us through the urban lane
No maps, no plans, just freedom in sight
Under the stars, bathed in city lights

[Pre-Chorus]
The rhythm of the night is calling our name
Step by step, we’re rewriting the game
No gravity here, we’re floating so high
Lost in the magic beneath the sky

[Chorus]
City lights, endless nights
We’re dancing under electric skies
Feel the rush, take the flight
This moment’s ours, hold it tight
City lights, endless nights
The world fades out, it feels so right
No limits here, no end in sight
Together we shine, burning bright

[Verse 2]
The streets are alive, they hum with desire
Every heartbeat fuels the fire
Your hand in mine, we’re breaking the chain
Exploring the unknown, no fear to sustain

The clock keeps ticking, but we don’t care
Time stands still when you’re everywhere
We’re painting this town with colors so bold
A story of passion, a tale never told

[Pre-Chorus]
The rhythm of the night is calling our name
Step by step, we’re rewriting the game
No gravity here, we’re floating so high
Lost in the magic beneath the sky

[Chorus]
City lights, endless nights
We’re dancing under electric skies
Feel the rush, take the flight
This moment’s ours, hold it tight
City lights, endless nights
The world fades out, it feels so right
No limits here, no end in sight
Together we shine, burning bright

[Bridge]
Ooooh…
The city’s alive, it’s breathing for us
Every heartbeat echoes, every moment is a rush
No boundaries now, just infinite dreams
We’re riding the wave, chasing the beams

[Final Chorus]
City lights, endless nights
We’re dancing under electric skies
Feel the rush, take the flight
This moment’s ours, hold it tight
City lights, endless nights
The world fades out, it feels so right
No limits here, no end in sight
Together we shine, burning bright

[Outro]
City lights…
Endless nights…
Feel it…
