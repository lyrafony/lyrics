--

[Verse 1]
I said too little, I spoke too late
I walked away and closed the gate
Now echoes haunt what once was mine
A silence carved in crooked lines

[Verse 2]
The things I did, the things I hid
The masks I wore, the truth I slid
Now press me down, a heavy tide
That no excuse can help me hide

[Chorus]
The weight of regret, it pulls me low
A shadow I can’t overthrow
But in this ache, a voice is near
Not loud with wrath, but strong and clear

[Verse 3]
It tells me pain is not the end
That wounds can break and also mend
If I will kneel, if I will stay
And not run from the price I pay

[Chorus]
The weight of regret, it pulls me low
A shadow I can’t overthrow
But in this ache, a voice is near
Not loud with wrath, but strong and clear

[Bridge]
I can’t erase what I’ve undone
But I can face what I became
And in the fire of what I lost
Begin to rise beyond the shame

[Final Chorus]
The weight of regret, I carry still
But not to break—it′s shaping will
And step by step, I learn to bear
A heart made clean by honest prayer
