[Verse 1]
In the shadows, where secrets lie,
I hear the whispers of the sky.
A warrior′s soul, carved in stone,
Fighting battles I call my own.

[Pre-Chorus]
Through the darkness, I will rise,
With fire in my heart and steel in my eyes.
I’m bound by fate, yet free to choose,
With every step, I have nothing to lose.

[Chorus]
I am the storm, I am the flame,
A warrior’s soul will never be the same.
Through the fire, I will stand tall,
Fighting for the dream, I will give my all.

[Verse 2]
The road is long, the night is cold,
But I’m not afraid, for my heart is bold.
Through every wound, I find my strength,
I’ll go the distance, I’ll go the length.

[Pre-Chorus]
Through the darkness, I will rise,
With fire in my heart and steel in my eyes.
I’m bound by fate, yet free to choose,
With every step, I have nothing to lose.

[Chorus]
I am the storm, I am the flame,
A warrior’s soul will never be the same.
Through the fire, I will stand tall,
Fighting for the dream, I will give my all.

[Bridge]
I’ll break through the night, I’ll conquer the day,
With every battle, I’ll find my way.
Through every challenge, I’ll never fall,
I’ll rise above it, I’ll stand tall.

[Chorus]
I am the storm, I am the flame,
A warrior’s soul will never be the same.
Through the fire, I will stand tall,
Fighting for the dream, I will give my all.
