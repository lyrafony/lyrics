[Verse 1]
Words fall short, they rarely align,
truth hides softly between the lines.
A glance, a pause, a trembling sigh,
speaks louder than the clearest lie.

[Pre-Chorus]
What’s left unsaid can cut so deep,
a silent language hearts still keep.

[Chorus]
Between the lines, the truth resides,
in shadows where the soul abides.
It whispers low, it lingers near,
the things we long to hold or hear.

[Verse 2]
We wear our masks, we play our parts,
but silence betrays the aching hearts.
The unspoken ties that bind us tight,
are often lost in the fading light.

[Bridge]
Beneath the surface, the currents flow,
carrying secrets we’ll never show.
But if you listen, you’ll come to find,
the deepest truths are felt, not signed.

[Final Section]
Between the lines, the truth resides,
in shadows where the soul abides.
It whispers low, it lingers near,
the things we long to hold or hear.
