[Opening]
Waves of light and shadow cast,
Electric mirage, fading fast.

[Verse 1]
Under wires, we chase the spark,
Lost reflections in the dark.
Whispers ride the current high,
Electric mirage, passing by.

[Pre-Chorus]
Through the haze, we reach the flame,
But the fire never stays the same.

[Chorus]
Electric mirage, burning bright,
Chasing dreams that take their flight.
Electric mirage, fade away,
Gone tomorrow, here today.

[Bridge]
Neon rivers crash and swell,
In the dream, weâ€²re doing well.
But the mirage will never hold,
Fading faster, growing cold.

[Chorus]
Electric mirage, burning bright,
Chasing dreams that take their flight.
Electric mirage, fade away,
Gone tomorrow, here today.

[Outro]
Electric mirage...
Disappear...
