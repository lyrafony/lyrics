[Intro]
Dust in my lungs, scars on my skin,
Yet somehow, I′m breathing in.

[Verse 1]
Torn by storms I couldn’t tame,
Worn by losses I can′t name.
Fell a thousand times before,
Still I get up, still want more.

[Pre-Chorus]
Whispers call me to give in,
But my fire burns within.
Bruised and bleeding, I won′t fall,
I′m still breathing through it all.

[Chorus]
Still breathing, still alive,
Through the wreckage, I survive.
Bitter winds can′t drown my song,
I′m still breathing, still strong.

[Verse 2]
Steps unsteady on shattered ground,
Echoes of doubts all around.
But the pulse inside won′t die,
I move forward, I don′t ask why.

[Pre-Chorus]
Whispers call me to give in,
But my fire burns within.
Bruised and bleeding, I won′t fall,
I′m still breathing through it all.

[Chorus]
Still breathing, still alive,
Through the wreckage, I survive.
Bitter winds can′t drown my song,
I′m still breathing, still strong.

[Bridge]
Every scar a badge I wear,
Proof that I was truly there.
I rise each time, I face the flame,
Still breathing, still my name.

[Outro]
Still breathing, against the sky,
Still breathing, I won′t die.
