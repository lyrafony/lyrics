[Verse 1]
Behind the smiles, the lies reside
False faces worn with guarded pride
Echoes of truth drowned in disguise
A masquerade of hollow eyes

[Verse 2]
Whispers curl beneath the skin
Secrets kept where shame begins
Cracks appear on polished guise
Revealing hearts in dark disguise

[Chorus]
Shattered masks fall to the ground
Silent truths without a sound
Falsehoods break, the veil is torn
Exposed beneath the weary scorn

[Verse 3]
The stage is bare, the act undone
What’s left beneath the fading sun?
A soul revealed, stripped and bare
No longer bound by false despair

[Chorus]
Shattered masks fall to the ground
Silent truths without a sound
Falsehoods break, the veil is torn
Exposed beneath the weary scorn

[Bridge]
In broken glass, reflections show
What’s real beneath the shadowed glow
A chance to heal, a chance to mend
Beyond the masks, the soul ascends

[Final Chorus]
Shattered masks fall to the ground
Silent truths without a sound
Falsehoods break, the veil is torn
Exposed beneath the weary scorn
