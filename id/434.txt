Title: Falling Forward

[Verse 1]
I tried to stand with steady hands
But every step slipped through the sand
I thought that strength would look like pride
But grace was found where I had cried

[Verse 2]
I reached for heights I couldn’t claim
And stumbled back into my shame
But something caught me as I fell
A truth too deep for words to tell

[Chorus]
I’m falling forward, not behind
Broken steps, but still aligned
Every wound, a secret door
That leads me somewhere worth much more

[Verse 3]
The world says stand or else you fail
But mercy walks a different trail
It meets me low, it lifts with care
And finds me falling—still aware

[Chorus]
I’m falling forward, not behind
Broken steps, but still aligned
Every wound, a secret door
That leads me somewhere worth much more

[Bridge]
I thought the fall would mean the end
But it became where I began
A road through pain, but not through shame
A quiet fire that changed my name

[Final Chorus]
I’m falling forward, not behind
Losing all, but still I find
That every tear, and every floor
Becomes the step I needed more
