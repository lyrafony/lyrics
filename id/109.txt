[Intro]
No matter where I go, you’re already there
Your presence lingers in the air, pulling me near

[Verse 1]
From the moment our eyes locked, I felt the spark
It wasn’t just a glance—it left its mark
The universe aligned when you came through
Now every path I take leads straight to you

[Pre-Chorus]
Every move I make, you’re always in my mind
You’re the rhythm in my step, the reason I find
A force so strong, it’s hard to ignore

[Chorus]
It’s a magnetic pull, drawing me closer to you
Every time I fall, it’s right where I knew
You’re the north to my south, the sky to my sea
Baby, you’re the only place I wanna be
This magnetic pull, it’s taking control
Of my heart, my soul, my everything, my whole

[Verse 2]
Your voice is a melody that never fades
Each word you say feels like it was made
To lift me higher, to heal my pain
Like gravity flipped, but it pulls just the same

[Pre-Chorus]
Every move I make, you’re always in my mind
You’re the rhythm in my step, the reason I find
A force so strong, it’s hard to ignore

[Chorus]
It’s a magnetic pull, drawing me closer to you
Every time I fall, it’s right where I knew
You’re the north to my south, the sky to my sea
Baby, you’re the only place I wanna be
This magnetic pull, it’s taking control
Of my heart, my soul, my everything, my whole

[Bridge]
What is this power you hold over me?
It’s like you’re everywhere I long to be
I don’t need answers—I just need you
You’re the missing piece that makes me new

[Final Chorus]
It’s a magnetic pull, drawing me closer to you
Every time I fall, it’s right where I knew
You’re the north to my south, the sky to my sea
Baby, you’re the only place I wanna be
This magnetic pull, it’s taking control
Of my heart, my soul, my everything, my whole

[Outro]
Magnetic pull…
You’re all I’ll ever need…
