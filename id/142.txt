[Intro]
Midnight calls, sirens hum, streets never sleep…

[Verse 1]
Raised in the fire where the weak don’t last,
City full of ghosts, shadows move too fast.
Taught to keep my head low, never trust a face,
Loyalty’s a gamble in this high-stakes race.

Walkin’ through the alley where the stories bleed,
Another lost soul, another dream that’s deceased.
Tales of the struggle carved deep in the stone,
A king with no throne, just a Glock and a zone.

[Pre-Chorus]
Dark skies, cold nights, nowhere to run,
Another fight, another war, another loaded gun.
Heavy chains, heavy heart, tryna break free,
But the city’s got a grip, and it won’t let me be.

[Chorus]
Ohhh, trapped in the cycle,
Runnin’ but the past moves slow.
Ohhh, lost in survival,
Tryna find peace in a world so cold.

[Verse 2]
They said power comes with a price to pay,
Friends turn foes when the stakes get raised.
Loyalty’s a ghost, seen it fade too quick,
Money buys silence, but it won’t heal shit.

Streetlights flicker like the life we risk,
Some make it out, most drown in the mist.
Pray for a sign, but the Lord stay mute,
Devils in disguise, tailor-made in suits.

[Pre-Chorus]
Dark skies, cold nights, nowhere to run,
Another fight, another war, another loaded gun.
Heavy chains, heavy heart, tryna break free,
But the city’s got a grip, and it won’t let me be.

[Chorus]
Ohhh, trapped in the cycle,
Runnin’ but the past moves slow.
Ohhh, lost in survival,
Tryna find peace in a world so cold.

[Bridge]
No love, no trust, just the sound of the rain,
Gunshots echo like a deadly refrain.

[Verse 3]
Maybe it’s too late to rewrite the script,
Maybe my fate’s in the cracks of the bricks.
Maybe the real ones never get their shine,
Just a name on a wall and a candlelight shrine.

[Outro]
Midnight calls, sirens hum, streets never sleep…
