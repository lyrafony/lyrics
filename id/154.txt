[Verse 1]
I gave you my heart, but you tore it apart,
With every lie, you pulled me further from the start.
The vows we made, they were never true,
I gave my all, but it was never enough for you.

[Pre-Chorus]
Promises broken, love turned to dust,
You took everything, betrayed my trust.

[Chorus]
Shattered vows, they lie in pieces,
All the love, it slowly ceases.
I thought we’d make it, thought we’d last,
But now I’m standing in the past.
Shattered vows, I can’t move on,
The damage done, you’re already gone.

[Verse 2]
I should have seen it, the signs were clear,
But I believed in you, kept you near.
Now I’m left with a heart that’s bruised,
Caught in the wreckage, deeply confused.

[Pre-Chorus]
Promises broken, love turned to dust,
You took everything, betrayed my trust.

[Chorus]
Shattered vows, they lie in pieces,
All the love, it slowly ceases.
I thought we’d make it, thought we’d last,
But now I’m standing in the past.
Shattered vows, I can’t move on,
The damage done, you’re already gone.

[Bridge]
I stand alone, the pieces scattered,
All our memories, now they don’t matter.
The love we built was just a lie,
Now I’m left with nothing but goodbye.

[Chorus]
Shattered vows, they lie in pieces,
All the love, it slowly ceases.
I thought we’d make it, thought we’d last,
But now I’m standing in the past.
Shattered vows, I can’t move on,
The damage done, you’re already gone.

[Outro]
Shattered vows, they’re all I have,
A love that died, so cold, so sad.
Shattered vows, I’ll let them go,
But the pain will forever grow.
