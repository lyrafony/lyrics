[Verse 1]
From heights unseen, the waters fall
Celestial streams that gently call
Through veils of time, they softly glide
A sacred flow, the soulâ€™s true guide

[Verse 2]
Invisible hands that weave and part
The currents running through the heart
With holy breath and quiet grace
They trace the lines of endless space

[Chorus]
Celestial streams, pure and wide
Flowing deep, a boundless tide
In hidden depths, their whispers gleam
Awakening the deepest dream

[Verse 3]
No mortal eye can catch their gleam
Yet in the soul, they brightly beam
A river vast, beyond the skies
That lifts the spirit, makes it rise

[Chorus]
Celestial streams, pure and wide
Flowing deep, a boundless tide
In hidden depths, their whispers gleam
Awakening the deepest dream

[Bridge]
With sacred strength and endless flow
They carry life where none can go
A covenant of light and peace
That bids all doubts and fears to cease

[Final Chorus]
Celestial streams, pure and wide
Flowing deep, a boundless tide
In hidden depths, their whispers gleam
Awakening the deepest dream
