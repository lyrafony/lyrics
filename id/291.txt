[Verse 1]
Through the storm, I’ve made my stand,
A warrior’s heart, a steady hand.
The world may tremble, but I won’t fall,
I’ll rise again, above it all.

[Pre-Chorus]
Unbroken, unchained, I face the fight,
In the darkest depths, I’ll find the light.
With every wound, I grow more strong,
A warrior’s spirit, where I belong.

[Chorus]
I’m rising, I’m rising, like a storm untamed,
Through the endless battle, I’ll never be the same.
I’m the immortal, born to last,
Through time and trials, I’ll stand steadfast.

[Verse 2]
I’ve walked through fire, I’ve walked through pain,
And still I rise again, again.
No fear inside, just a will to fight,
I’ll stand my ground, with all my might.

[Pre-Chorus]
Unbroken, unchained, I face the fight,
In the darkest depths, I’ll find the light.
With every wound, I grow more strong,
A warrior’s spirit, where I belong.

[Chorus]
I’m rising, I’m rising, like a storm untamed,
Through the endless battle, I’ll never be the same.
I’m the immortal, born to last,
Through time and trials, I’ll stand steadfast.

[Bridge]
I won’t bow, I won’t break,
For the future is mine to make.
Through the endless battle and the endless night,
I’ll rise as the immortal, and take my flight.

[Chorus]
I’m rising, I’m rising, like a storm untamed,
Through the endless battle, I’ll never be the same.
I’m the immortal, born to last,
Through time and trials, I’ll stand steadfast.
