[Verse 1]
I feel the fire crawling in my veins,
a wild desire I just can’t contain.
Every heartbeat’s screaming your name,
pull me closer into the flames.

[Pre-Chorus]
No escape, no way to hide,
we’re lost in this endless ride.
One spark, one touch, ignite,
we’re burning up tonight.

[Chorus]
Burning inside, out of control,
you light me up, you take my soul.
No turning back, no slowing down,
we′re on fire, we can’t come down!

[Verse 2]
The city’s glowing like a battlefield,
our hearts are racing, nothing feels real.
You and me, we′re gasoline,
set the world ablaze, feel the heat.

[Pre-Chorus]
No escape, no way to hide,
we’re lost in this endless ride.
One spark, one touch, ignite,
we’re burning up tonight.

[Chorus]
Burning inside, out of control,
you light me up, you take my soul.
No turning back, no slowing down,
we′re on fire, we can’t come down!

[Bridge]
Let it burn, let it rise,
feel the fever in our eyes.
No regrets, no wasted time,
we’re alive, we’re alive!

[Final Chorus]
Burning inside, out of control,
you light me up, you take my soul.
No turning back, no slowing down,
we′re on fire, we can’t come down!
