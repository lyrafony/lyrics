[Verse 1]
Silver footprints on the floor,
Whirling shadows beg for more.
Midnight whispers in my ear,
Shuffle close, dissolve the fear.

[Chorus]
Moonlight shuffle, twist and slide,
Slip through dreams we cannot hide.
Moonlight shuffle, soft and slow,
Spin until the night lets go.

[Verse 2]
Velvet secrets in our hands,
Gliding over shifting sands.
Chasing echoes of the sound,
Moonlight shuffles all around.

[Chorus]
Moonlight shuffle, twist and slide,
Slip through dreams we cannot hide.
Moonlight shuffle, soft and slow,
Spin until the night lets go.

[Bridge]
Flickering in fading skies,
Dancing with closed-open eyes.
Moonlight pulling on my skin,
Let the endless dance begin.

[Chorus]
Moonlight shuffle, twist and slide,
Slip through dreams we cannot hide.
Moonlight shuffle, soft and slow,
Spin until the night lets go.

[Outro]
Moonlight shuffle...
Never low...
