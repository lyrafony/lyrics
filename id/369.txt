[Verse 1]
Before the dawn, beyond the end
A circle closes, without bend
No start to hold, no final line
A presence vast, beyond all time

[Verse 2]
The silent source of every breath
The keeper of life, defying death
The first and last, the endless way
That guides the night and crowns the day

[Chorus]
Alpha and Omega, without a face
The endless dance, the boundless space
No start, no end, forever true
The whole of all that’s me and you

[Verse 3]
No chain can bind this mystery
A timeless song, a symphony
The pulse beneath the cosmic sea
The breath of all eternity

[Chorus]
Alpha and Omega, without a face
The endless dance, the boundless space
No start, no end, forever true
The whole of all that’s me and you

[Bridge]
From dawn to dusk, from earth to sky
The silent vow that won’t deny
A truth that holds when all is gone
The ever-present, endless song

[Final Chorus]
Alpha and Omega, without a face
The endless dance, the boundless space
No start, no end, forever true
The whole of all that’s me and you
