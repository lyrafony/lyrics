[Verse 1]
Locked inside, lost in the dark,
felt the weight, felt every scar.
They tried to keep me on the ground,
but I won’t stop, I won’t back down!

[Pre-Chorus]
Fires rising, burning bright,
no more shadows, just the light.
I can feel it, deep inside,
tonight’s the night I say goodbye!

[Chorus]
I’ll break the chains, tear down the walls,
nothing can stop me, I’ll take it all!
No more fears, no more pain,
I’m rising up, I’m free again!

[Verse 2]
I was blind, I was caged,
trapped inside a losing game.
But now I see, now I know,
this fire’s mine, I’m letting go!

[Pre-Chorus]
Fires rising, burning bright,
no more shadows, just the light.
I can feel it, deep inside,
tonight’s the night I say goodbye!

[Chorus]
I’ll break the chains, tear down the walls,
nothing can stop me, I’ll take it all!
No more fears, no more pain,
I’m rising up, I’m free again!

[Bridge]
No regrets, no looking back,
I won’t fade, I’m on the track.
Feel the thunder, hear me roar,
I’m not a slave, not anymore!

[Final Chorus]
I’ll break the chains, tear down the walls,
nothing can stop me, I’ll take it all!
No more fears, no more pain,
I’m rising up, I’m free again!
