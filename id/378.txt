Title: Wounds That Heal

[Verse 1]
I tried to hide the broken skin
The places I had let pain in
But hiding made the wound go deep
Where even silence couldn’t sleep

[Verse 2]
I covered cracks with painted grace
But truth still lived beneath my face
And in the places torn and bruised
I found the parts that love had used

[Chorus]
These wounds that heal, they burn, they bleed
But plant the very things I need
They mark the path I didn’t choose
But in the breaking, I refuse to lose

[Verse 3]
They tell a story few can see
Of grace that shaped the loss in me
They didn’t go when I denied
But now they’re where I come alive

[Chorus]
These wounds that heal, they burn, they bleed
But plant the very things I need
They mark the path I didn’t choose
But in the breaking, I refuse to lose

[Bridge]
Let them ache, let them remain
I don’t resent the gift of pain
For what was torn has now been filled
Not as I planned, but as He willed

[Final Chorus]
These wounds that heal, they stay, they speak
They make me whole, though I seem weak
They’ve shaped a heart no fear can steal
These scars I wear are wounds that heal
