[Verse 1]
I’m standing on the edge where the silence meets the sound,
A million voices screaming, but I can’t break down.
The world is spinning faster, pulling me apart,
But I’ll find my center in this crowded dark.

[Pre-Chorus]
They say it’s too loud to hear your own mind,
But I’ll sift through the chaos, leave it all behind.
Every broken signal, every static call,
I’ll find the quiet buried beneath it all.

[Chorus]
On the edge of the noise, I’ll make my stand,
Carving out a moment with my own two hands.
In the eye of the storm, I’ll find my way,
Turn the loudest echoes into peace today.

[Verse 2]
The city hums like thunder, a symphony of pain,
Neon lights and shadows, but I feel no shame.
I’ve learned to breathe in rhythm with the disarray,
And turn the weight of the world into something I can sway.

[Pre-Chorus]
They say it’s too loud to hear your own mind,
But I’ll sift through the chaos, leave it all behind.
Every broken signal, every static call,
I’ll find the quiet buried beneath it all.

[Chorus]
On the edge of the noise, I’ll make my stand,
Carving out a moment with my own two hands.
In the eye of the storm, I’ll find my way,
Turn the loudest echoes into peace today.

[Bridge]
Oh, the noise will try to drown me, pull me under the tide,
But I’ll rise above the waves, let the calm be my guide.
This is my space, my sanctuary in the fight,
Even in the chaos, I’ll claim the light.

[Final Chorus]
On the edge of the noise, I’ll make my stand,
Carving out a moment with my own two hands.
In the eye of the storm, I’ll find my way,
Turn the loudest echoes into peace today.
