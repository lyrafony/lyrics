[Verse 1]
Your touch is fire, it burns my skin,
Velvet chains pull me in again.
We’re dancing on the edge of sin,
But I can’t resist where we’ve been.

[Pre-Chorus]
Every whisper cuts through the air,
A secret bond we both share.
No turning back, no fear to show,
This forbidden path we both know.

[Chorus]
Velvet chains, they hold me tight,
In the shadows, we steal the night.
Bound by lust, we lose control,
Two hearts breaking every rule.

[Verse 2]
The world outside fades into haze,
Lost within your smoldering gaze.
Each moment feels like our last,
Yet I’m trapped in this endless past.

[Pre-Chorus]
Every whisper cuts through the air,
A secret bond we both share.
No turning back, no fear to show,
This forbidden path we both know.

[Chorus]
Velvet chains, they hold me tight,
In the shadows, we steal the night.
Bound by lust, we lose control,
Two hearts breaking every rule.

[Bridge]
If they knew, they’d call us wrong,
But this fire keeps us strong.
In the dark, we find our truth,
Forbidden love, eternal proof.

[Chorus]
Velvet chains, they hold me tight,
In the shadows, we steal the night.
Bound by lust, we lose control,
Two hearts breaking every rule.

[Outro]
Velvet chains, they never break,
A love too deep, a choice we make.
In the silence, we’ll always stay,
Forever bound, come what may.
