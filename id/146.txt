[Intro]
Footsteps heavy on a one-way track…

[Verse 1]
Cold wind whispers through the empty blocks,
Every step forward, feel the past pull me back.
Taught to never slip, taught to never break,
But the weight of the game is a price you take.

[Chorus]
No way back, no second try,
One wrong move and the stars won’t shine.
Bridges burn, lessons fade,
Ain’t no mercy in the path we made.

[Verse 2]
Tires spin fast on a midnight run,
Can’t slow down ‘til the race is done.
Every man’s chasing something unseen,
But the road don’t care what your dreams might mean.

[Pre-Chorus]
No escape, no rewind,
Only ghosts left behind.

[Chorus]
No way back, no second try,
One wrong move and the stars won’t shine.
Bridges burn, lessons fade,
Ain’t no mercy in the path we made.

[Bridge]
Streetlights blur, past grows dim,
Only shadows know where I’ve been.

[Verse 3]
Maybe I was never meant to stay,
Maybe I was born to fade away.
Or maybe the fire in my chest still burns,
Waiting for the moment when the tide will turn.

[Outro]
Footsteps heavy on a one-way track…
