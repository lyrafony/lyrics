[Verse 1]
Hands stretched out but never give
Only takers who won’t forgive
Counting favors, marking dues
Trading grace for selfish views

[Verse 2]
Voices loud with endless claims
Yet deaf to others’ silent pains
Demands rise high, but help is thin
Selfish hearts that trap within

[Chorus]
Chains of demand, heavy and tight
Binding souls in endless fight
Give with strings, expect in vain
A cycle born of selfish gain

[Verse 3]
But truth will break the iron clasp
Release the heart from grasp to grasp
Grace flows free, no bonds remain
Love unchained will heal the pain

[Chorus]
Chains of demand, heavy and tight
Binding souls in endless fight
Give with strings, expect in vain
A cycle born of selfish gain

[Bridge]
Let mercy reign and soften pride
Break the chains, let love abide
From selfish rules, find freedom’s way
And walk in light of honest day

[Final Chorus]
Chains of demand, heavy and tight
Binding souls in endless fight
Give with strings, expect in vain
A cycle born of selfish gain
