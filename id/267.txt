[Verse 1]
They handed me a throne of gold and lies,
Said wear it well, but I saw through their guise.
A crown too heavy for a soul like mine,
I cast it off, let the false light dim and die.

[Pre-Chorus]
No chains to bind me, no throne to claim,
I’ll find my power in a nameless flame.

[Chorus]
This weightless crown sits light upon my head,
Not forged by fear, not born from what they said.
I wear my freedom, my own decree,
A kingdom built from who I choose to be.

[Verse 2]
Their voices echo with demands and rules,
But I’ve no need for borrowed jewels.
I carve my path where shadows intertwine,
A sovereign heart that answers only to time.

[Pre-Chorus]
No chains to bind me, no throne to claim,
I’ll find my power in a nameless flame.

[Chorus]
This weightless crown sits light upon my head,
Not forged by fear, not born from what they said.
I wear my freedom, my own decree,
A kingdom built from who I choose to be.

[Bridge]
Let them kneel to hollow gods of stone,
I’ll stand alone, my will my throne.
The world may call, but I won’t comply,
My crown is silence; my strength won’t die.

[Final Chorus]
This weightless crown defies their control,
It bends no knee, it pays no toll.
I rise above, no chains remain,
A ruler of dreams, a master of pain.

[Outro]
Beneath the stars, I chart my way,
No borrowed glory, no debt to pay.
The weightless crown will never fall,
For true sovereignty belongs to all.
