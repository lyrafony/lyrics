[Verse 1]
No signs, no lights, no guiding hand
Just quiet earth and shifting sand
The path begins where comfort ends
No turning back, no need to pretend

[Verse 2]
They said the truth would feel like fire
But this is colder, raw, and higher
A whisper deep inside my bones
That pulls me far from all I’ve known

[Chorus]
On this unmarked road, I walk alone
No footprints clear, no voice, no throne
But something moves me step by step
Through shadows cast and fears unmet

[Verse 3]
No crowd to cheer, no map to trust
Just ash and wind and holy dust
The way is narrow, steep, and slow
Yet still I walk, and still I grow

[Chorus]
On this unmarked road, I walk alone
No footprints clear, no voice, no throne
But something moves me step by step
Through shadows cast and fears unmet

[Bridge]
Not every journey starts with light
Some begin in silent night
But even then, the road is true
If walked with what you cannot view

[Final Chorus]
On this unmarked road, I walk alone
No footprints clear, no voice, no throne
But still I move, though blind and bare
Because I know that Someone’s there
