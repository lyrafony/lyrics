[Verse]
From the moment I saw you,
The world lit up, everything felt new,
You were my sun, my reason to smile,
Together we walked, with no need to look back.

[Verse]
Your words were my shelter,
Each day with you was a bright new dawn,
We promised we’d never be apart,
We were invincible, forever we'd stay strong.

[Pre-Chorus]
But now the wind carries your voice,
A soft whisper in the quiet night,
I find myself searching for your eyes,
Even though you're gone, I feel you by my side.

[Chorus]
You were my first love, my only love,
A love that will never fade away,
Every corner holds your essence here,
You were my first love, my only love.

[Verse]
I walked through places we once knew,
The echo of your steps still calls to me,
Every corner holds a memory of you,
And though I'm alone, you're here with me.

[Verse]
The stars still shine just like before,
I know somehow you're still here,
Time moves on, but you remain,
In every breath, in every heartbeat, you're near.

[Pre-Chorus]
But now the wind carries your voice,
A soft whisper in the quiet night,
I find myself searching for your eyes,
Even though you're gone, I feel you by my side.

[Chorus]
You were my first love, my only love,
A love that will never fade away,
Every corner holds your essence here,
You were my first love, my only love.
