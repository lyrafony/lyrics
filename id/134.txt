[Intro]
Feel the rush…
Let’s go…

[Verse 1]
We’re chasing shadows under the moonlight glow
No maps, no plans, just where the wild winds blow
The night is calling, it whispers our name
Two restless souls with nothing to tame

Your eyes are fearless, your spirit untamed
Together we’re running, no rules to maintain
The city fades out, the world disappears
It’s just you and me, conquering our fears

[Pre-Chorus]
We’re breaking free, no chains to hold us down
This moment’s ours, no limits we’ve found
The stars above are lighting our way
With wild hearts, we’ll never stay

[Chorus]
Wild hearts, we’re running free
No boundaries, just you and me
Through the night, we’ll chase the fire
Feel the rush, take us higher, higher
Wild hearts, we’ll never conform
We’re dancing through life, riding the storm
Together we’ll fly, feel the spark
Baby, we’re driven by wild hearts

[Verse 2]
The road ahead is unknown, but it feels so right
Every heartbeat echoes beneath the starlit night
Your hand in mine, we’re leaving it all behind
No turning back, this is how we find

The thrill of freedom, the taste of the air
We’re alive in this moment, no time for despair
The world can wait, we’re living for now
Our wild hearts beating, here and wow

[Pre-Chorus]
We’re breaking free, no chains to hold us down
This moment’s ours, no limits we’ve found
The stars above are lighting our way
With wild hearts, we’ll never stay

[Chorus]
Wild hearts, we’re running free
No boundaries, just you and me
Through the night, we’ll chase the fire
Feel the rush, take us higher, higher
Wild hearts, we’ll never conform
We’re dancing through life, riding the storm
Together we’ll fly, feel the spark
Baby, we’re driven by wild hearts

[Bridge]
Ooooh…
Feel the wind, it’s carrying us far
No fear, no doubts, we know who we are
The night is endless, no end in sight
With wild hearts, we’ll own the night

[Final Chorus]
Wild hearts, we’re running free
No boundaries, just you and me
Through the night, we’ll chase the fire
Feel the rush, take us higher, higher
Wild hearts, we’ll never conform
We’re dancing through life, riding the storm
Together we’ll fly, feel the spark
Baby, we’re driven by wild hearts

[Outro]
Wild hearts…
Feel it…
