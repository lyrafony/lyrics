[Intro]
The lights flicker… can you see them?
Neon dreams are calling… feel them.

[Verse 1]
Neon lights flash, painting the air
Every step we take feels like floating there
No maps to follow, no rules to keep
Just shadows dancing in electric sleep

Your silhouette glows under purple skies
This moment’s alive, it never dies
We’re chasing visions, they pull us near
In this world of neon, everything’s clear

[Pre-Chorus]
Step by step, we’re losing control
The rhythm’s guiding us, taking its toll
No need to rush, let the night unfold
Baby, this story’s ours to be told

[Chorus]
Neon dreams, they light up the sky
We’re dancing through colors, no reason to try
Feel the glow, it’s taking us high
Lost in the magic, where time flies by
Neon dreams, they’re burning so bright
Together we’ll chase them through endless nights
No limits here, just you and me
Baby, this is our neon symphony

[Verse 2]
The streets are alive with electric streams
Every heartbeat echoes like neon beams
No fear, no shame, just pure desire
We’re setting the night on fire

The world fades out, it’s just you and I
No past, no future, just the neon sky
This dream is real, it’s burning so loud
With every step, we rise above the crowd

[Pre-Chorus]
Step by step, we’re losing control
The rhythm’s guiding us, taking its toll
No need to rush, let the night unfold
Baby, this story’s ours to be told

[Chorus]
Neon dreams, they light up the sky
We’re dancing through colors, no reason to try
Feel the glow, it’s taking us high
Lost in the magic, where time flies by
Neon dreams, they’re burning so bright
Together we’ll chase them through endless nights
No limits here, just you and me
Baby, this is our neon symphony

[Bridge]
Ooooh…
The neon whispers, it’s pulling us far
No boundaries now, just who we are
The night is endless, no end in sight
Together we’ll shine in neon light

[Final Chorus]
Neon dreams, they light up the sky
We’re dancing through colors, no reason to try
Feel the glow, it’s taking us high
Lost in the magic, where time flies by
Neon dreams, they’re burning so bright
Together we’ll chase them through endless nights
No limits here, just you and me
Baby, this is our neon symphony

[Outro]
The lights fade slow… but the glow remains…
Neon dreams… feel them in your veins…
