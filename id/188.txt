[Intro]
Once we stood, side by side,
A bond so strong, it couldn′t hide,
But now I see through empty eyes,
The truth beneath, the web of lies.

[Verso 1]
I gave you everything I had inside,
But you turned away when I needed you to fight.
You wore the mask of a friend so true,
But now I know the real you.

[Pre-Coro]
I trusted you, I gave you my soul,
But now you’re nothing — just a hole.
You broke me down, you tore me apart,
Left me to bleed with a shattered heart.

[Coro]
Shattered trust, broken beyond repair,
You took my faith, and left me in despair.
I’ll never forget, I’ll never forgive,
What you’ve done to the life I tried to live.

[Verso 2]
The lies you spoke, they cut so deep,
Now I find myself unable to sleep.
I wish I could erase the pain,
But all that′s left is this endless rain.

[Puente]
You were a ghost in the light of day,
Wearing a smile while leading me astray.
Now the silence speaks louder than you,
And I’ll never fall for your lies again, it’s true.

[Coro]
Shattered trust, broken beyond repair,
You took my faith, and left me in despair.
I’ll never forget, I’ll never forgive,
What you’ve done to the life I tried to live.
