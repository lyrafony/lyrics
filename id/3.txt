[Verse 1]
We don’t need a plan, we just take it slow,
No expectations, let the feelings flow,
A smile, a laugh, and a kiss below,
We’re living the moment, don’t need to know.

[Chorus]
Carefree love, just you and me,
No strings attached, we’re wild and free,
In each other’s arms, we feel the sea,
Carefree love, just let it be.

[Verse 2]
No promises, we’re just having fun,
Under the stars, we shine like the sun,
No worries on our minds, we’re always on the run,
This love’s so simple, yet it’s never done.

[Chorus]
Carefree love, just you and me,
No strings attached, we’re wild and free,
In each other’s arms, we feel the sea,
Carefree love, just let it be.

[Bridge]
We don’t need to talk, we just know,
This love’s a rhythm, let it grow,
No rules, no control,
We’re carefree, just letting go.

[Chorus]
Carefree love, just you and me,
No strings attached, we’re wild and free,
In each other’s arms, we feel the sea,
Carefree love, just let it be.

[Outro]
Carefree love, feeling so right,
No need to rush, we’re flying tonight,
Carefree love, under the moonlight,
Let’s keep it simple, keep it light.
