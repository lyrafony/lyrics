[Verse 1]
Slide across the golden floor,
Velvet sneakers beg for more.
Groove so sweet, canâ€²t resist,
Every heartbeat shakes my wrist.

[Chorus]
Velvet sneakers, glide and spin,
Dancing loud, skin to skin.
Velvet sneakers, light and free,
Floating over melodies.

[Verse 2]
Fingers snapping in the haze,
Lost in rhythm, lost in daze.
Shoes that whisper, shoes that shout,
Velvet magic twisting out.

[Chorus]
Velvet sneakers, glide and spin,
Dancing loud, skin to skin.
Velvet sneakers, light and free,
Floating over melodies.

[Bridge]
No rules tonight, just the sway,
Velvet feet will lead the way.
Touch the sky with every slide,
Velvet sneakers never lie.

[Chorus]
Velvet sneakers, glide and spin,
Dancing loud, skin to skin.
Velvet sneakers, light and free,
Floating over melodies.

[Outro]
Velvet sneakers...
Velvet dreams...
