[Intro]
No matter where the universe may lead us tonight
Our love will shine like a beacon in the fight
Through every turn, through every tide
We’ll stay together, forever side by side

[Verse 1]
The stars may shift, the planets rearrange
But our connection remains through every change
Through time and space, we’ll always align
Two souls entwined, a bond that’s truly divine

[Pre-Chorus]
Even when the world spins fast
We’ll slow it down, make moments last
In your arms, I’ve found my place

[Chorus]
We’ll forever be in orbit around this love
Circling each other like the stars above
No force can pull us from this endless ride
Together we’ll stay, you and I

[Verse 2]
The seasons fade, the years drift by
But our hearts still echo as the days pass by
Every revolution brings us closer still
A timeless rhythm, an unbroken will

[Pre-Chorus]
Even when the world spins fast
We’ll slow it down, make moments last
In your arms, I’ve found my place

[Chorus]
We’ll forever be in orbit around this love
Circling each other like the stars above
No force can pull us from this endless ride
Together we’ll stay, you and I

[Bridge]
If the galaxies collapse and the skies grow dark
I’ll find you again, leave no trace or mark
Through infinite space, through eternity’s call
Our love is the center that holds it all

[Final Chorus]
We’ll forever be in orbit around this love
Circling each other like the stars above
No force can pull us from this endless ride
Together we’ll stay, you and I
