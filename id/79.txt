[Verse 1]
I run through darkness, a fleeting trace,
chasing shadows I can’t replace.
They dance ahead, just out of reach,
promising answers but teaching speech.

[Pre-Chorus]
The harder I follow, the faster they flee,
a paradox wrapped in mystery.

[Chorus]
Chasing shadows, I lose my way,
running after a fading day.
But in the hunt, I find my name,
defined by the echoes I can’t contain.

[Verse 2]
Each step I take leaves no mark behind,
yet every moment reshapes my mind.
The chase is endless, the prize unclear,
but still I run, drawn by what’s near.

[Bridge]
The shadows whisper, “Keep moving on,”
their voices soft like a distant song.
Though they may vanish with morning’s light,
the journey itself becomes my fight.

[Final Section]
Chasing shadows, I lose my way,
running after a fading day.
But in the hunt, I find my name,
defined by the echoes I can’t contain.
