[Verse 1]
I’ve been running from the mirror,
Afraid to face what’s real.
Every choice feels like a gamble,
Every step, a spinning wheel.
What if I fall? What if I break?
The weight of doubt is hard to take.
But deep inside, I hear a voice—
It whispers softly: you have a choice.

[Pre-Chorus]
It’s scary to stand when the ground shakes beneath,
When failure looms like a thief.
But every stumble shapes your flight,
And courage grows in the night.

[Chorus]
Don’t let fear steal your dreams tonight,
You’re stronger than the shadows of might.
Every fall is a lesson learned,
Every scar is a flag you’ve earned.
Rise above, let the fire ignite,
Failure’s just a step toward the light.

[Verse 2]
I’ve built walls to keep me steady,
But they block the view ahead.
Every “no” feels like a sentence,
Every “maybe” fills with dread.
Yet somewhere past this endless fight,
There’s a spark that burns so bright.
It calls my name through all the noise—
A quiet truth within my voice.

[Pre-Chorus]
It’s scary to stand when the ground shakes beneath,
When failure looms like a thief.
But every stumble shapes your flight,
And courage grows in the night.

[Chorus]
Don’t let fear steal your dreams tonight,
You’re stronger than the shadows of might.
Every fall is a lesson learned,
Every scar is a flag you’ve earned.
Rise above, let the fire ignite,
Failure’s just a step toward the light.

[Bridge]
Maybe falling isn’t losing,
Maybe breaking makes you whole.
Each mistake is part of growing,
A map to finding your soul.
So take the risk, feel the burn,
From the ashes, you will return.

[Outro]
Failure’s not the end of the road,
It’s just a chapter, a story untold.
Keep moving forward, don’t lose sight,
Your moment will shine, it’s worth the fight.
Failure’s just a step… toward the light.
