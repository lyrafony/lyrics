[Verse 1]
I’ve been bound by invisible chains,
Tied to fears I can’t explain.
Every word feels like a weight,
Every thought, a locked gate.
The echoes of the past remain,
Haunting me through joy and pain.
But deep inside, I feel the pull—
A quiet voice says, “You’re beautiful.”

[Pre-Chorus]
It’s hard to break what you can’t see,
These shackles forged from memory.
But freedom calls through every scar,
You’re stronger than who you think you are.

[Chorus]
I’ll break these chains, one link at a time,
Let the weight fall away, let my heart align.
No more holding on to what drags me down,
I’ll wear my freedom like a crown.
With every step, I’ll claim my power,
This is my moment, this is my hour.
I’ll break these chains, I’ll set myself free,
The person I’m meant to be.

[Verse 2]
The voices whisper, “Stay the same,
Don’t risk the fire, don’t play the game.”
But I’m tired of living in disguise,
Of hiding truth behind my eyes.
The locks are rusted, the keys are near,
I’ve carried doubts for too many years.
Now I’ll shatter walls that held me tight,
And step into the light tonight.

[Pre-Chorus]
It’s hard to break what you can’t see,
These shackles forged from memory.
But freedom calls through every scar,
You’re stronger than who you think you are.

[Chorus]
I’ll break these chains, one link at a time,
Let the weight fall away, let my heart align.
No more holding on to what drags me down,
I’ll wear my freedom like a crown.
With every step, I’ll claim my power,
This is my moment, this is my hour.
I’ll break these chains, I’ll set myself free,
The person I’m meant to be.

[Bridge]
Maybe pain was just a teacher,
A lesson learned, a soulful preacher.
The wounds may ache, but they won’t last,
Through breaking free, I’ll heal at last.
So I’ll tear apart these binds with grace,
And find my place in open space.

[Outro]
Break the chains, let the pieces fall,
Stand unbound, answer freedom’s call.
No more limits, no more fear,
The future’s bright, it’s crystal clear.
I’ll break these chains… and finally see,
The person I’m meant to be.
