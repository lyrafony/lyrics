[Verse 1]
I walk alone through city streets,
Under the cold glow of neon lights,
The machine watches as I breathe,
A thousand eyes, and no escape in sight.

Every corner, every turn,
There’s nowhere left to hide,
The gears keep turning,
And I’m stuck in the tide.

[Chorus]
In the shadow of the machine,
Where nothing’s real and nothing’s clean,
I’m just a pawn, a piece to move,
In the shadow of the machine, I lose.
In the shadow of the machine,
I’m never free, I’m never seen,
I fight to breathe, I fight to live,
But to the machine, I have nothing to give.

[Verse 2]
They know my past, they know my name,
Every mistake, every broken frame,
I’m just a number in the code,
Lost in the web, down this endless road.

There’s no escape from what they’ve made,
I’m just a voice that they’ll never hear,
The walls are closing in,
I’m drowning in the fear.

[Chorus]
In the shadow of the machine,
Where nothing’s real and nothing’s clean,
I’m just a pawn, a piece to move,
In the shadow of the machine, I lose.
In the shadow of the machine,
I’m never free, I’m never seen,
I fight to breathe, I fight to live,
But to the machine, I have nothing to give.

[Bridge]
I scream to the sky,
But no one answers me,
The machine has heard it all,
And now it’s part of me.

[Chorus]
In the shadow of the machine,
Where nothing’s real and nothing’s clean,
I’m just a pawn, a piece to move,
In the shadow of the machine, I lose.
In the shadow of the machine,
I’m never free, I’m never seen,
I fight to breathe, I fight to live,
But to the machine, I have nothing to give.

[Outro]
In the shadow, in the shadow,
I’m just a ghost, fading slow,
In the shadow of the machine, I go.
